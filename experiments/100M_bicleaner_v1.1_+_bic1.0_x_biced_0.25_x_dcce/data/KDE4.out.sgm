<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & konqueror; menu on Extras website. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions dependent without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish website yourself, where you can insert texts to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features from & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on how to use & konqueror, and the built-in functions, refer to the & konqueror manual.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror, select Settings enlargements.... Open the tab Tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase, that & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras Crashes. then you can view the page that has crashed & konqueror; crash, or the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Analog filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in the & konqueror area, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: DVI element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory of local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views, in order to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representation that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful coloring and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of nesting depth or the picture of another file property such as name, owner, group, or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of sub-ordered rectangles occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected. frames are drawn to render the nesting of the entries, and this frame will need space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is possible for the labeling and avoidance of space losses to divide areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Display in Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are digitized with the library gPT2. of course, each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitiate; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. they should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">It opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you are using these shortcuts, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to ask questions to other users of & digikam; in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digifile; homepage for news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digitised; signing up in the Developer's Mailing list. instructions to announce in the Developer's Mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you started & digitised; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data output is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digitiate; will also be used as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the uppermost folder that contains images as a base folder. no picture will be changed. no picture will be changed during browsing the folder.</seg>
<seg id="68">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can edit and digitize your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can work & digitised; possibly also bypassing it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw video cameras in the Help Center assistance menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are digitized with the library gPT2. of course, each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB flash memory device. the camera is then connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">GPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and are slow transmissions via the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPT2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images of digiKam. if the exif support is not present in libgPT2, you might not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about digitizing; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is essentially easier & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digirelocate.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with or LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaum, above the horizontal line of separation or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped into keywords, data list or searches.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar. so the filter on the filename will only work if it is displayed in the icon view.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos that are managed by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, or by the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose CD Importing images to be scanned. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to enter information about this collection. in order to access the album features, you must right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums, so that you can group together under a common name. selecting or deleting new collections from the tool bar can be used to sort your photos. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums. sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The eldest, average, new testers: these put the date on one of the oldest, the newest picture or the average section of the album. to do this, try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & quot; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is to help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the right button of the mouse and click in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each picture is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying pins in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while while thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by using all preview images in the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit via preferences; set up. select the albums here and customize the thumbnails section.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about digitizing; works. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing indicates your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose all the features that have been digitised or edited. you can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the edit section, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. you can view and edit your photos with image editing.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to do so, and how to customize them when your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data with when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">The simplest one is to right-click on the preview and select Rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My date list; organizes your photos according to the data. & digitikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lists; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My stitchword; or click on an existing keyword, and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substituting of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by right-clicking on the keyword and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu will appear that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking on it and editing keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the right button of the mouse button and select the album title in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In order to use keywords, you first need to add keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can right-click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords associated with it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have entered a photo with keyword, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Subscription menu. the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Encompass all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">End of the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search hits. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria. after you have been saved, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press OK and the search will be done. the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window. the Text Field Store Search as is used to select a name in My search list. if you want to change your selection again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>

<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added and deleted by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it. in addition, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitised; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digitiate; find suitable images. again, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini-program. you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it. move Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this, of course, presupposes that your images contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitiate; provides a beacon in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; add L Dem luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the beacon and its window will be opened. if you are back in the main window, you can quickly open the beacon with L extras icon.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right range of the window and drop there. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you choose preview synchronize from the tool bar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then they are also carried out with the other image. you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairing links from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. the right image is displayed in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the beacon. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom end of each pane you will find a built-in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB; in the preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works as well as in other views. simply use the zoom control under the images or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - off the fashion word? digital assets administration views every part of the process following the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos takes up, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use pictures. we'll focus on the process for digital photographers the & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need to stay longer without stock management for a specific photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly don't use & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you have to incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure. your image files must be organized somehow on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of the archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that you save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digitioccurred; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? for this purpose & digikam; to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos in the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or to put the images in the correct place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords will be edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of meta-data consists of many sections. file names and calendar dates have properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let anyone know your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, have associations, memories, the historic period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam; you can save as much text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as label. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was Earth not a tedious planet ahead of Google Earth? well, because with images the train of the spatial presentation is now running at speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually replicate your trips with images with geographical indications. & gt; can also export kml files that you can export with GoogleMaps. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the installation page is from & digitised; as information it should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the work title of the photographer. examples of this may be title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memo to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for offerer): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">The solution to this problem is digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each picture. & digitised; will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, plate loss, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, widened superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we deal with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which hold longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, and dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism in order to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called Isobuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Write the media with a description, date & author and store it on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk failures.</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks hold the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower tempera, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. these are in particular read errors and displacement meters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed process sensors. these can cause serious damage. so, on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable result of a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in connector.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should be aware that it meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be aware that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be secured. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shakes which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can keep in mind how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should think about getting all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are referenced to photos. your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. data transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs are at least secure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">This is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at work bench systems. in case of notebooks, the share of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the widest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural barrier to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more worsen. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is now available for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget airplane disasters: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential locking: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made. this backup comes from a versioning system closest to the exception that it is scanned and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security using ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, associated XMP files, originals, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">For valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to forge a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & Dollar; Parted resident / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the rip if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software to read, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to save gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG - Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is an identification technology that allows users to embed their data in a file themselves. file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xinquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it from an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP means that the metadata is stored separately from the image file, but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching adoption of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edit, you can use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries, code them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Addition of a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; connect it to your computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. you will find another description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's note, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side strip from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that some digital cameras are not available.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button Selected is stowed until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New to download is available. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download all the buttons or download the selected ones, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; download the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you need to select them first and then delete ejected selects.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded; you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera. if you want to delete the camera file completely, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use very meaningful names for the photos. the filenames are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate file names if you upload photos of different recording formats to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this last option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different date format than the default format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-%% D% H:% M:% S. to do so, turn on the option Date & Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file name option, you have the option of changing the file names in lowercase letters. or in upper case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitiate; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to complete automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not supply this information, it leaves & digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select Auto Turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, & digikam; use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case saved & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button to select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done & digitised; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position that can be displayed in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitiate; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and finally by manual input from known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geo-geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows, and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the insignia of homely coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitiate; try to give you so much control over his work steps as possible. there are many settings that have changed the behavior of & digikam; to access these settings, you must select Setting Settings. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to previewed preview or launch image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author line: this field should include the professional name of the photographer. this can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a closer description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the name that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as these are the picture other & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rings. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam;. this metadata also contains other programs and can be imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, using the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitiate; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; try to add, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digifile; Albumfolder that has none of these extensions has been digitised; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the beactable these settings will be enabled if possible. however, some images have different sizes and synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you can only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overlapping and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are defined here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please refer to this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression settings, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease image quality because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time for extracting and unpacking. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Use the option TIFF files to compress the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it does not affect the image quality since the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph is written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam the image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option excels the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings. the setting colors will create some unusual results, since it displays the top lights in various pink tones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitizer; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, because it is carried out during raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from one colour space to the other is to be translated as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Warning when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all of your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Configuration of ICC profiles You have the possibility here & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures, not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are built in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain any color tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how to reprint your image from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface it can support & digikam; many modules written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will then be loaded from & digikam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Preferences.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information about KIPI modules, please visit the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other intersections switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage devices are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera bar. you must specify here the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To make your digital camera digitised & digitised, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitised; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">The confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the sleeves allows you to edit & digitize the conversation; when deleting a photo in an album, you can see more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used silently through & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes to the right sidebar without asking questions. otherwise, you must save the changes with the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see the display of the editing screen from & digikam; when starting, it might accelerate the start-up of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Looking for new photos, it forces & digikam to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the startup time of & digikam;. if something is deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & abrikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitiate; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view and edit your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; they may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the Save from the toolbar. note that you can't restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save this using file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore Restore button or the button Restore the image processing Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting or recovering editing by selecting Edit Resproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo / restore Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; using the reset button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword, by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made any changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. usually, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want to do so, you can change this in the editing dialog by & digikam; see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. complete picture preview pages can be printed out of your choice. you just need to select the images using the default methods and select Print Assist from the Album Select menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitised; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, please note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or just change to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selector with the keywords used previously in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typing keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, it will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. keyword names are searched into the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to label a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search results. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop the tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to add keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on Keine keywords which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and filed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Diverse.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviance from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those from your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB does so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another colour space and so you have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colours we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the two-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibriate your monitor since sRGB trusts that your; onitor is ripped to sRGB. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, you must either callibriate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Same, Automatic Figure and Contrast Enhancing from the Correction Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminosity values over the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like this: this method adjusts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. in this way, almost every luminance range achieves the same number of pixels. sometimes the same is achieved with very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest range and a re-jib of all values in between. this is only visible in full-blown pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is used. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original image, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram appears that will be changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow is adjusting the shadow details of your photos or even dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the controls above, use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are also set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also show a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit coding is the popular JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tone mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so you can always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under paint gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitizer; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar-effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure from a short flash beam and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity monitors the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a daylight-optimised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeat the strength of the neon light. in case of large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can, for example, experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. any changes you perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple lamp strength / contrast / gamma, the tool is sound correction for improving exposure. even though the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the application described here. more specific the three slide valves below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into the picture and that can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be used to show whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often used. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour tweezers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two controls that can be used to interactively change the output rate as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hatched image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: these buttons can store the set values in the filesystem and load them later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shades, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the entry rate of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sense. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a ventral arrow to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digitised channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly-developed tool to mix the tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are shown at the bottom: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the picture will keep the general brightness too, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown on (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Z5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenes and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefinder: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefinder.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a little cold to the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitisation; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional texture of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed below (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Digitized; adding tool frames can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly circumvented the image with a colored line, niepce resets it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the width of value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio earlier.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in an image at any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; Apply tool template you can place a template over an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">Use the picture template in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the size of the template. if you want to add your stencil to the stencil, just send an email in English to the & digifile; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your templates folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Magnify: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurr mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychosocial. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blurred. SLR cameras typically require more aftermath than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera has been used in internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening suit. you can use the menu entry to call for corrective sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. generally, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image can refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften notes with the menu entry correcting soft notes and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. if you make the blurr mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are produced near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to apply. this allows for a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty flaws in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the blur masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). fuzzy masks has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected design algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gaussian Faltung is even very strongly influenced by the removed pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurr is sharp. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all edges, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filter is at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image will have to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of focus correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider feather sets the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tints allow a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most widely-developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Tabs and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes uniformly in all directions while a value is smoothed at 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD, a high value wavy-like pattern is generated. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step length [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should ideally choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; reduction of noise is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus cleared smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to see luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details, and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value enhances the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smothered, but it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase of the phase. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother, if it is too high, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpens a picture. use the tool to soften the softener with the menu entry correcting soft notes and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitisation; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove palettes, film grains, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture rendering. the texture replacement is done with a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformable noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious fine-grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by the scanned light and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"" "the" "" "Hotpixel" "" "tool allows hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp." ""</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality crude mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; light pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the Wizard with the dark screen button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark picture to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and automatically loads it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel corrected on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitisation; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettierlanquot; (shaded) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes the necessary closing time possible in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there are otherwise blurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color and gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that was made without this filter. the tool of vigilance correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vigration correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of damping damping at the point of the highest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vigration.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers only provide you with positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitio; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar concentric effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficients fourth degree corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can almost be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second grade. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion grid. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the General parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values magnify while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a Preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonical or cushion correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes. ideally, perform this correction as the first. if you re-cut a picture and then carry out a tonical correction the effect would be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal assistance line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. then move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards you can correct the toner / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Transformations of image editing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. please note: if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add film granularity if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos, because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmic effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digitised filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce movie grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the producers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film Körner Effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granny view specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are often required, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film loading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digitised filter; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digitised filter uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients slowly change are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch out.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitio; filter engraving patterns your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digitised filter is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: similar to the wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of blurr effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom ambiguity: blurred the image along star-shaped lines emanating from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographed from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft sharpness: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Vibratory sharpness: blurred the image due to random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the color font in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the End Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn's copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digitisation; image editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph has the wrong orientation, you can take it through mirroring or turning in the right direction. you can find the tools for this in the menu Transforming Rotating or Transforming Spider.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo recovery was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each image size can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo-inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo shootings by enlarging a small image of the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the standard enlargement of the standard for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently underperformed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to create an image. image editing allows this very simple. in order to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by right-clicking on it.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or File save entries in the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the support help enable you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden mean is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother auxiliary lines if you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for achieving good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates on this kind a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles derive from the above-mentioned golden spiral. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles do not represent a triangular triangles. diagonals on these lines can cause a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things turn around an angle. you can do this with the & digitised; image editing and tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available at the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point in the image you can attach it to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recalculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The modeling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal loop, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shutter this effect is usually negligible, but two crossings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitiate; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the formats available are dependent on your system and, in some cases, by the way these libraries were compiled.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to place a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the extension is listed in the list, it will be edited and edited; you can change this list of file extensions & digitised; in the configuration section, you will find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw picture format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the configuration section, you will find further information on the use of modules with & digitioccurred;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading of quarries only with the program dcraw, which is in & digikam; containing more than 200 raw file formats. all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are frequently saved in avi or mpeg format. and digitised; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built-in capabilities to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digitised; the & kde; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback.</seg>
<seg id="692">Go forward to the previously visited record in Chronik. you can only go forward if you went back before.</seg>
<seg id="693">Synchronisates the metadata between the database and all files of the current main window. the images inherit the database's metadata and not the other way around like this menu.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the bottom left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all adjustment of the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini-program. you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it. move Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this, of course, presupposes that your images contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallet files that are installed by & kde can apply either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the page view. here you can also change the color name.</seg>

<seg id="725">& calliviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & ktoriviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& ktoriviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. & graph viewer; graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & Placards; re-calculates the graph and represents in & ktoriviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & Placards; to open or to open the graphs in & quot; in a & Placer; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knots and one hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional needed software: & calliviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of the graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. in the beginning, if you start & ktoriviewer; without argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the Graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & cviewer viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will also be used. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings ktoriviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside a running & calliviewer; & eg; in the file browser or the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & cisviewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can let all graphs of your last session be opened again. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be completed by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed over several pages without a header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal load page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & cgraph viewer; specify if a graph is opened outside a running session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Session Management page gives you the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & cgraph viewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at each start of the session.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphene. it produces representations according to the springboard model. it uses the Kamada Kawai algorithm, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springboard model for ungerified graphene. it uses the Fruity-Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multiple-lattice for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should specify the graph file as parameters, and display the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms special options, or alter the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (erect or ungerized) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerized graphene).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be shown, if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI element with this mouse pointer, to get more help with this item (if any).</seg>

Flickr makes it possible to show his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put your camera's photos online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your identity to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed 'Yes', you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started two times, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to the Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as tags during high loading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Open, Friends and Famillie, you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF key of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loads an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera mode. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any track data from a location for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialogue takes the coordinates from one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set up with the displayed map. choose the region in question and sie.Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely out of the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the exixool is used to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow for the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you do not need to select these albums as hierarchically. the three buttons on the right-hand side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image creates a page creates a new page in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; KuickShow.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your corresponding images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider preview pictures allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album Tabs for the preview images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found for example also in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module Digital Camera Client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently does not have any documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function. this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any destination format. JPEG is supported when writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also insert a basic image transfer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transfer is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave them black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg-output file. if possible, keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file named the source of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can use the code to start the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets via the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amp can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG-switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button to start the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is completed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images into an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, start number and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can scale or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be shown with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview will be previewed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to send.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected pictures from the list of images to send.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images you can open the OK button of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not take care to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and used again every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must enter the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format from the File Format menu is not very well suited to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted for lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG images in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format, the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the Close button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau you will find a window with questions about how to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation activate very elegant displays using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is shown in the bottom left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually slide it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option of randomly choosing images ensures that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly choosing a different effect between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through these images, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. persons, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you add your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the browser view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images appear on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own preview image, which is of course also for places, keywords, and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the name, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to open the image asset window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog will display to you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the inscription or description field, the captions and descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can be either part of the total date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the images by specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window from & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays the date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entry preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will see only pictures of that time in the preview. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is available in & kphotoalbum; included and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described; integrated version that you can create from the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example for these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created that can be seen on the overview page. read information about export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description. for example, all images from a party are displayed. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so he can search your images with low resolution, resulting in a lower transfer time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you create are not in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, properly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three based on base folders or URLs. a subfolder is created in these, whose name you specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the picture information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can be passed on independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file looks for the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can access via the File Exports menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy near the .kin file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file is otherwise very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import file... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in description.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import is made up of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then to which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you specify the category of people to be imported to the imported file (if you are a domain), while this category is called in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. you can see an example of this in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps of (1) capture the information about your pictures, via (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are stored and will use it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will see the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different icons, with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described how you can define different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Sub-categories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up full members groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group, instead of all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it can be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures. demo database can be accessed either via the command line using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, which makes it possible for some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications include their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order by albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Thus simulating & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category persons, for example, you will use & kphotoalbum; so do, so whether you have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see at the top a menu and a toolbar. below the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown in the picture, where the picture is taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see those comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">View three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can, because the names used are moved up, find the people faster and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add comments to them. in this case, simply click the above and back buttons, which are located under the thumbnail of the image above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it there, in order to make it an subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires you to sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make your own window by drawing it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... button, which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you would like to see this window again later, use the Options... and then window / hide window. this will be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images in case you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Delete button or select Delete Select in the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use pictures somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them into. & kphotoalbum; do not yet support you to insert the CD in question. so, if you want to avoid annoyance on how to avoid interlocking your images, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who want to make it inaccessible and click on the current view lock in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can see, and lock the menu item All in addition to current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means that you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures closed, so that all pictures you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures shown again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password change in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection only serves to repel the view to private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all want your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; using a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click here on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can enter the image in the image and zoom out. the zoom button lets you zoom in again using the mouse. the Plus button zooms in in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the key button sets the zooms, so that each pixel corresponding to the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus-button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the image using the context menu functions from the context menu. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image using the comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view, you will see an image in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">This is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview. if you want to view categories in the thumbnail view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the mark after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will be allowed & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn off the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select On the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation for & Povray should be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object is displayed in the wire modellar views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object already selected, as all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu bar or the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to accept those changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the object shown with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a portion of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the field of Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window setup or if you need another arrangement, you can set them as you like. you can also save several window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, pull the anchor to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, pull the anchor to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the anchor in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from anchoring, drag the anchor to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the support bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the bevelling bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... save. a dialog is displayed in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Renders icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the section of the subsection and enter the picture cut for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the characteristics that & Povray are used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. you can find a detailed description of the rendering properties in the user's manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are less than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling reads the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive, recursively because each pixel is divided further and further, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further followed and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the jet process called Jittering. when you switch on ittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray; import the scene file, select File Importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet complete the complete command set by & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the object code to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendering. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. here you can find the path to your retention and version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene file, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the contextual menu of the wire model views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you check high detail accuracy for extended projections, all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When viewing the bottom, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. details on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section it is explained how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep in mind the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything flawlessly, you will see at the first launch of & kpovmodeler; the following set of windows:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols so often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this tutorial, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wiremodel view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view properties, in which you can find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you use the Apply button or paste button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a box (insert final body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the button. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite infinite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom when you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first sub-object. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigments), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments shows only a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and sphere in the preview, just click the Apply button and then go to the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called single-color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select single-color each time and change the colors in the view of the property properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic mode of working of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the property properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on Sphere Pigment, then choose colored and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effects and reflections already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of the possibilities for you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog work. thus, the scene is processed pixel for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest item in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversible command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to change the default short commands for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up tool bars. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump mapping as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickShow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc;</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may want to set existing multimedia keys so that they work as & Amarok; short commands. by doing this, make your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be run because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use the kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, you can exchange your scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable executing external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively simply. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now ask & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuclicked: submenu itemTitle paths Includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to remove an entry, you can use the dcop Amarok script called dcop Amarok script removecustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages which the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be downloaded with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of catechoscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is completed, you can place it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the Amarok page; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can easily drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. perhaps you will find only a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then, the playlists browser is the right one for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok, and enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; use relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To make up-to-date pieces visible when changing the piece causes the playlists to pop up / unroll to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing to the context-browser, the context-browser automatically switches to the context-browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set up the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by marking own fonts, the otherwise grey section is activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlists Window, Player window, and context Browser. click Select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection selector for foreground and background color.</seg>

<seg id="1224">The On-Screen display subwindow allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is checked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selections. if your own colors are not checked, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field introduces the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the OSD is to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the scanned and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allow & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. add or delete music files). also, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collections (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists then appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The portion of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down driver: allows you to choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql configuration section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: will the host enter where the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data required to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The carton card last.fm establishes the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can send the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting enables & Amarok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in the context Browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs contained therein, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by searching in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this causes crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use at least 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag; print "Mistakes when writing the tags from $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: trademark lookup error: trademark lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check whether Amarok will use the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amaranapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To correct this bug, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems clarify the easiest way through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appeared. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBlive) or by the dmix module for alsa (Software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you to find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another sink (for example, the sink sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people, if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Soundserver with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure the artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1309">Presumably & Amarok; compiled before installing xine or GStreamer. therefore, the. / configure routine has not compiled these output modules. you must reconfigure and install Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Now I have & Amarok; new installed, but the output modules still don't appear. and now?</seg>
<seg id="1311">You probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program. although GStreamer is installed, you will need to install the GStreamer-devel package. the same is true for xine, you must install xine-devel. then you need to recompile and install xine-devel.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces. if you're happy with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the playlist to save them. you'll find this button in the toolbar of the playlists window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have own playlists, you can add them to the playlists browser. if the playlist is included in your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, you can already find these playlists in the tree view. with a right-click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a packet management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, has a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlists window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or the currently running stream. right underneath is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area will change the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch from the available analyzer by right-clicking on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also located under the running text. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the play buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or the volume. with the play buttons you can start / stop playback, and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer use extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the Player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter them, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">You can split the playlists in two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows will later be replaced in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used previous versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the subwindow will take off. the information presented there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok. besides, the information can be collected in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you will see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the images may have any name, but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred. the context browser will also display covers images that were downloaded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played right away.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest score pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub-window. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all pieces in each area to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text sub-window, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts written from other web pages using the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button will allow you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com based on the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces are sorted according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack-albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sorted by Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces are sorted by genre and sorted by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">You can adjust and combine the grouping at will by means of the remaining buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last knob you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically recount your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located right under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a drop-down selector with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. there are different time frames available, starting from the last 24 hours to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leds the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue. this function adds the selected pieces to the queue. as a result, you will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player. see section about the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and burn either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialogue for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files into the garbage bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, which causes various interpreters to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Uplift compilation - Changes a record marked as a compilation album back to a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed in different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes dealing with many playlists quite simple. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connection from & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok, it must be included before starting & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop them on the list. if you are done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you find an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL. if you enter tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the musik.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simple case dropping. in this case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the items you have to play. you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by whitespace, search & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing whitespace, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not after entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can look for bigger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this looks for all the pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking on the entries with the right mouse button. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar's toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions. on the left, you will find the Add button to add playlists to the playlist. to the right, you can save playlist, empty playlists, and Random folders.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnified Analyzer. the refresh rate can be set by right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is a menu. it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window above the right mouse button. you can set up & Amarok's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example renditions and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and recovery, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current play are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. using this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select visualisations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting action cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big collection in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the plays are played: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are pre-specified (the details to set up these later).</seg>

<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio-Strobler). this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double-click the playlist you want, drag them to the playlists window, or right-click on them and then choose loading. this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set Modi Zufällige Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlists will be added to the next piece change, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: setting Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. in the same menu entry, dynamic mode can also be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New fill leds the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist, and you can change the settings.</seg>

<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will grow continuously, the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist. if the setting is active, the already played pieces will be removed with respect to the settings played.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces were recently played.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist by each played piece. if you set more than 1, the playlist will grow continuously, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The Settings on the right-hand side has been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you tick more than one playlist, add & Amarok; random pieces from each of the playlists you have crossed.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog. that will have the same effect as if you put the files directly from the top view into the Project View. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burning" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described using the What is the? help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you are not using files for a multiple session CD. it is intended for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes any files from the medium, it only hides the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create one copy of a CD, which you can then burn later. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows you to copy DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can also create one copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. besides, converting / decreasing a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire (video) data of the source media in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD + R (W), which will completely delete the contents. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools like Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used as standalone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black margins.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the included medium. this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is ticked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info, locks and blocking of the drive or ejecting media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selection and drag of files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow section that is only visible if the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog to change the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard layout to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here you can set general program settings. almost all functions of & k3b; should function straightaway. this dialog is for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many others & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so it is more of your taste and the type of task that the included programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () void copyDvd () void release burnDvd () void release burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface that can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString Name, QString designd void addUrls (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString Current Name) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; -Read for & kde; with it you can easily record audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many coding which encodes these WAV files (lossless compression) by default (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD are read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as I said already, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass some copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not cover the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling to read a & CD will be explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you will stumble frequently at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starting the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case must first connect to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start the reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the directive - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it should be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the File Manager, so that an already read-out file is selected to code rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, pipses) for program events (such as reading & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main installation dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as Encoder, for setting the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC there are also others such as' greats' or 'monkey' available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG easily lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG plays is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo devices. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the play. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a title. good Enough for music by young people, portable devices and auto-stereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or fetched automatically from freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title must be added to & kaudio creator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters needed (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the CD; and in addition, the information without the & CD; no more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. any information can anyway be obtained at a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if you use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval from & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which extract program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood all, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may be found using a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the output program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look inside the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only In case of incomplete information contact us, so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is easier to find a & CD; entry will start immediately the reading of the & CD; if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror- &gt; Rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not work. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path the load between the hosts is distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work at the same time as the server, but since many firewalls are running the 8880 protocol by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send & CD; data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number simultaneously: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check out the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the box is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget to use this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, some may need to flatten something to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems sufficient. the resulting compression factor is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to Version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including full path) and output file (including full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to encoded WAV files: at a dual core or quad or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set of & kaudiocreator; quit. this configuration is used as default for each reading a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; on hard disk runs off. we will create and setup MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on hard disk, was built in the previous section, because we want to pick up data from the freedb. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD; the screenshots look a little different from those for one & CD; with successfully logged data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data will be manually entered rather than picking it out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example is to be found. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, check the section Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully collected by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window appears and you can select the database entry that best matches your opinion on your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current titles' input field, the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current titles' input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividually per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD Editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least at what & kaudio creator; this option is set to the Code tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see help with the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the selected CD; in this example it is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or select the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the selection clause of the reading process, so this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider Orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen when trying to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occured directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, readout and coding are parallel. note the status message in the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. the computer used with a AMD64 doesn't seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third assignment is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions provide a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package. if you're reading this, you probably already have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is addressed to people compiled from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adapted to your needs when it's running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls on many different programs has many different settings. the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of different card flashcards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still am reading? even if only the Help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program, without any indication of how it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program starts), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author can not maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual for & kaudiocreator; intended. whoever wants to add or change something useful, may do it. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you have managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; ist der MIDI- und Karaokespieler von & kde; besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke juxtaposition of texts also has some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is required for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -Windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (real-time or text events) .kmid will automatically determine the used method.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you end & kde; quit while playing a song, kmid will start playing with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window to the & kmid; this works also with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the & kmid; (in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played back to each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the slider back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece, so interrupts the playback. press the space key while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and others use both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically retrieved, which is used for a song, so that you don't have to adjust anything manually. so, if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event type, select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that summarize you. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the collection under the point Organize. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the rights in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears again the file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using file opening or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically adds to the collection, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then add the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu pick-up sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs, or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song to vice versa, select the button preceding piece, the entry preceding piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets you sound a trumpet when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all necessary conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the assumption is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define keymap "A more keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI's patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and do not omit any line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument require to tune to the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the midi file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here the term drum-patch of the patch is meant, in which each sound is another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how notes are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel. take a look at the provided Keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to another. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the Percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio indicates in which ratio pitch bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM thought that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-benefit event with the value of 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find it in the Settings menu, Item MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to view the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the section channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information on how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, activate the Automatically add settings to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default speed, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only switch to the & konqueror; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the midi files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you only want to play the first file. so, set automatic adding to the collection and open it. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. I'm currently studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. I'm currently trying to take some time. as a hobby I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group, I will list all of them with a postcard or a MIDI file. before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me because I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anybody. I would like to emphasize that I only continue programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westin, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error notification or even only a supportive email.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a soundcard, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card unless you can of course hear no music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, his group and all of his sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, selecting Playlists from the menu must be selected from the File menu, selecting either the Edit Mode, or selecting another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically ended by opening another source. this would be disturbing for the end animation though, the user can therefore quit the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / smilgt; In the source package of & lt; / lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer available.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how to play a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even add the special embed video to YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is always taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the encoding must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension needs to be functional for the X server. for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">They use dvdnav.dll, dvdsource, source, source, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Will there be hints how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play it (not from VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is the user root after connecting the device. it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / cdrom is pointing to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaken. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; -environment for the & kde; work area. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and powerful project management are required.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about posters, and to learn about its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start directly with the reading of the chapter's work with the editor of posters;</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right explanation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a Lay (English lay) & latex; macros can be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book on it. to be able to rule correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As well as other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a Cologne with text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ program class, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again using the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assist from & Kile; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some possibilities for creating the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is used to select the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [PDF], report [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], Projector [Beamer], foils [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this topic are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you want more areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will save you by highlighting time and pedestrians.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments, entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line to shell the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in menu items... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; allows the document to be subdivided into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; the source search can be very helpful. once a DVI file is created, jumps & Kile; with a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the usual output art of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the tags search, the elements of the DVI file are inserted with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file was clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text was pointed to. as soon as clicking on a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI file is called on a 'nearby', and there is no call from & eyepiece; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the edit tool bar, the three large selection boxes should be conspicuous. the selection boxes have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for example items such as keywords, notes, notes, or links. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice over a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kebtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã © e is used for the definition of the font size. it can be specified for the main text, the notes, etc. it contains the following font sizes:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ doc class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the shell construction or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically execute the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be sought in the logging after the errors. if you are using rapid construction, you should start automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few sets should have another font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow a change of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin to environment} up to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for changes in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to capture the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, it can be added to certain fonts, bold prints, cursive prints, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be represented italically with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; -markup language was presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do so, a quotation, a few passages in the grease and cursive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document is viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer). with an external viewer, its window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device-independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are necessary as for the document creation (see). on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI file into other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search permits the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do so, only Modern will need to set up settings in Kile... Building tools to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and subsequently clicked on prior search. the jump to the corresponding place in DVI; the viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do so & Kile; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (Set Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the & DVI file, an error can occur. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file returns the source code in the source code. in the editor you can then use the Previous LaTeX bugs and other LaTeX errors for syringes between the bugs. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jump to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hang users from & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documents class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template rather than the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Placards; as an internal editor. & Placards; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about posters, and its opportunities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter's work with the editor of posters;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands found in & latex; and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a given shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source code and emphasize these. for example, the & latex; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping marks. these are a special type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items like toggle-tokens or the respective buttons possible make the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; .though & Posters; already outstanding possibilities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; encapsulates many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only curl thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word from the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also applies & latex; commands with a back button (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for a quicker convenience.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Deletes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands in editing environment for a possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient orders, the overview can be lost quickly. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. the Edit TeX group contains some important commands corresponding to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the padlock.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located in front of or behind the padlock of a & tex; group #, it jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested ground clips, the overview can be lost quickly. this command closes the last open group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used as tools. for the appropriate implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "used for two simple reference marks. also for the end of the application the character is used. & Kile; knows this case and carries two concluding marks for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic import of double quotation marks can be set up under Preferences box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in specific settings (e.g. german or French) and thus German or French reference marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, enter & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close within a tables environment closes & Kile; the current line with\\\\\ with an adjoining line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although offering a good source code execution, it has been extended into & Kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;) are still extended. three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can set up for different working methods under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to grind the list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command. alternatively jumping marks can be added, so that a jump to these positions can be possible with the addition of the jump brand NEW jump mark and the desired parameters then can be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings Kile; set up... Kile; settings can be made to these lists. there can be different wish lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as WÃ ¶ rters of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call for full-service mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for enhancing the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the full-time mode over the menu in full-time environment or keystroke Alt + Shift-key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Settings Kile; set up... Kile; settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, that & quantaplus, have, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. they can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a kpart, we start editing plug-ins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all included plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a storage location, you can use & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leader as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important with regards to news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by recording the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions performed when something is happening in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file in CVS, as soon as it is added to the project etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings Dialoges can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the receiver list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Annotation is simple. it can either be selected the annotation entry from the editor pop-up menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role in the project from the following possibilities: team Manager Area Manager Subproject leaders should be given the respective area or sub-project names, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that are DTD-agnostic and support web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus, -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by configuring Quanta. this dialog stretches over a number of pages that are treated in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: large / small-case of tags: large / small-case of automatically inserted tags. normal upper / lower case, the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Uppercase / lowercase of attributes: uppercase / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lower case, the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, will be inserted immediately after the tag.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and finish tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding end tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic substitution of accent characters: controls automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the default button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project's properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; periodically creates backup copies, so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be previewed either in the editing pane or in a separate view (or documentation in a file path), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and the source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is messed up by modifying MDI modes and docking / detonating views. it is equivalent to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of non-enquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the VPL and the source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser node in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty spaces are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifW shortcut is something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are Kpart-applications from third-side, which can be reused by any Kpart-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load Component in read-only mode: check whether the plug-in refuses to load. only-read-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus, whether the information entered is correct. you can choose to save the entry, even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variable is displayed. normally appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the postmarks, with line numbers and conditions are listed. normally appears in the bottom corner.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger appears. appears normally in the bottom Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if required, or it tells the plug-in to listen to Debugancies. this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variable and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution is continued. if a debugging request has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if there is a debug statement, execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next level as if there wasn't the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentary. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; Front-end and a KD of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how you & quantaplus; can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they allow & quantaplus. they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, which include & descriptionrc; and tagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic links of image buttons (above the editing window), insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details about converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folder carries the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but only element above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute, etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editing dialog and the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus, is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus, is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that assembles the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog. this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose easy instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element of the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file, one & PHP is described; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">/ lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "function" returnType = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be ediedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Apply 1 for & quantaplus; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set by setting actions... created. click New action will lead to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. clicking on the user defined button can be assigned a shortcut; with Keine the current keyboard shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples of & quantaplus, themselves are the quickstart dialog or the various Read in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript t.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, & quantaplus tries to find the script in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus, used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script input can be received from & quantaplus. in the input field, input can be specified, which is to be sent to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be rerouted. there are two types output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the standard output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the value to the output selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. choose settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan its use, activate the "Edit Day" dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconic; choose from the & KMenu;, graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconic; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green becomes mostly as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the tool bar dialog via Settings tool bars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save in the right folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please fit your file descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable addition of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in the & quantaplus; repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this documentation e.g. & PHP; func1 = Section1.html... [Context] ContextList = sec. html tag1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag2</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation for example:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequently displayed at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the domain of the docrc file, which is used for creating context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of semi-detached context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the discerning resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. in various places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, send toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus users can download them. the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useless for publication. to make an airport commentary, we recommend that the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their Passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields (URL Preview can remain empty) and start the upload with clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bars toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed properly, a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the string that should appear in! doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion to & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these concepts and to take full advantage of them, one must first acquaint themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns emitted by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse pointer, or open the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further extension of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and the connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, click on the icon representing the tag. now you can enter the data for this exactly inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate to & quantaplus information; to navigate, open and roam them. in the presentation with file ladders there are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view displays all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can change attributes and namespaces with it. the application system oriented to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed for project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two boxes at the bottom of the window, can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all the changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts running out give all error messages (as there are any) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a icon and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the option to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar by e-mail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; for that, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; designed for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an underlying idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & quot; Developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what has already developed someone else? thanks to the & kde; Apply, it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-coated actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look in the section about templates. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting the special characters contained in the clipboard, converts to & HTML code contained there, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s first and foremost to paste & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Toggles the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Enter directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and turning of the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example, to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set by settings actions... added. toolbars are saved by toolbars toolbars or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. it does not delete it from your hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus) team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or anyone else has done and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities of the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP need to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus, if this tag contradicts the rules in this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on them. click on activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line end identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS, or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, the switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse-cursor but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from above downwards as, for example, after filling out the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled in.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.dbf) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local file system to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. with server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder, and you can select an exact selection according to your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Profiles subwindow or Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) will be ignored for project-related operations, such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, showing a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, event actions can be turned on and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, open & quantaplus, the last one opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus is closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten by BAE programs. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk - option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers.</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving feature or a risk. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool toolbar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows for the adaptation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are designed in & quantaplus, best stackable using the toolbar menu. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is discussed below in the Add section of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and icons can be set using either context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions like toolbars can be removed, toolbar rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified where actions on this or other toolbars can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By invoking the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the action will be removed and action displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bars... and set settings to set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snips and files for connecting. & quantaplus; used Templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or merge each directory existing on the system into the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before using exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree below project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Save as template as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and dropping to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files, and create a site template, enter and secure a name for the template. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can set header lines and footers or dynamic with & PHP; design, insert files or link them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in subwindow templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates stored files. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, select the folder view with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elteristic attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template folder. if a root folder is set like this, it would disable templates in this path, except they would appear explicitly. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project, allowing copying of content templates to a folder with headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use context menu (to show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders, copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source-Editor, which can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second subdivides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source editor when necessary, in which the changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document that contains & PHP, a small green symbol indicates the VPL. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor as well as in the VPL; the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; this mode is activated by pressing F9. pressing F9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is configurable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; -View you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically, the period of time can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows you to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change to the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style file by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed from any other anchoring tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the Listen-Assistent are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; they will need to be used in this release the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">In contrast to other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet design can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check codes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing the file name of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 folder 2 -o destination folder, diff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 Folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows for manually entering filenames, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog memorizes your selection and displays them next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected, for B and C, however a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When combined, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog you do not need to select any files, you can just close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, allow the mouse to rest a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the color indicates the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes through automatic merging or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the Quelputs; displayed. this is just a placeholder in case you change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and pasted somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The Text & lt; Conflict Conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the numbers or Ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">If you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, high, down, side down, side down, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the exit window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the Insert key, you can switch between insert mode and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Conducting section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Up / Ctrl-Picture) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to automatically copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this option is checked, it will automatically copy whatever you mark and manually copy the manual. be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32 based systems use cart-return character\\ r\. Kdiffusion 3 does not keep the line end of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KIP set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you shouldn't use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected font is not supported, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered scanned. on these systems presets automatically adjust an uncontrolled color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of whitespace characters is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then drops.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart-return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, others only save a newline character '\'. but then files with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison look identical, but then files with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison look identical, but then, if this option is checked, this option will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still shown, but they are treated like white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow for very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white notes by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then you better use the Select A / B / C functions for any unresolved white conflict from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignorere C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and conducting a merge. see for details under documentation on how to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the interface. changing this option does not apply to the currently running program. you must end & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language will be set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper end is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding a short reference appears, which is local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually set, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white notes in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignorere C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded oversee column. but sometimes you may want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first commit this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first commit this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is only used in line distance. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergo expression that matches all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first pair of clip. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $keyword earns $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you might like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion 3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line identies. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each match is substituted by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the composition. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations change only the data that the line-like algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may inadvertently not notice certain differences and in the worst case will destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in one folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and show the simulated changes without really performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, do not merge. to start the merge, you must select the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While scanning the folders, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were then compared are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder finishes, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors of red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green, then yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active, if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories are active. then Selects & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & kdiff3; B according to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging (unsure), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is processed after the other. you indicate the status column when the merge was successful, and corresponding messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is okay all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected full-time analysis in the setup dialog, KRS3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the three-folder merged mode C is used as the destination, B is chosen as the destination in the two-folder merged mode, and the A and / or B will be used as the destination when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to bring only the current item, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merge actions still exist due to conflicting file types, a message appears indicating the defective items. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog appears with the options Execute, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you first want to see what would happen without really making any changes, you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merge window will pop up (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">Once you have finished with a file, select another directory merge to start / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work with the next entry will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on a fault, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. if you want to restart the merge (F7 key), you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them once again. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (eg. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be specified with a .cvsignore file. (look under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous dot selects a file than hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links are treated like normal folders and searched for recursively. (note that if the option contains a link in itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare just the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the same as the date of change. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal size. this can, for example, be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates Synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions to merge are selected so that the two folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view will remain visible while merging individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the directory & text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder merged. to do so, use the current file merge from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be restored and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merged.</seg>
<seg id="2416">But this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished from a link to a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link destination. (ftp:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way of editing permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in differences observer. to start KDef3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in KSZ3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two complete input files. but if it is applied as a KPart, & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kdiffusion 3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiffusion 2 (now hot compare) exist already. furthermore, the name KRA already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by browsing through the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (eg kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical first; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines for next to each other, this are is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort is so far too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly found; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all features of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KR3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install in a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you shouldn't have problems with compiling. if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you must re-read the folder with the refresh function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is downlighted. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini show of all virtual desktop space. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works in both a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops and the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows inside & ppager can be moved. the movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has to set up the two entries pager... and exit. if however click on an application inside & Kpager; otherwise, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, maximize, Desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the pager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is ticked, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktop will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; show the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is tracked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the pager; otherwise, only the empty areas will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the ordering of the pager can be specified: classic & Kpager; appear in a 2xN grid, as seen from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in horizontal and vertical bar in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move windows as symbols or with their content.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select Disconnect Switches... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you will need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated for new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as pictured above. the main window of & Kmag, displays the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default, magnified & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can view & Kmag; this causes a select screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown mode) or the environment of the mouse-cursor at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to see the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default click; / Qt; cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift, press key or use the & MMB; you can postpone the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to paste it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the display. stopping the update brings the required CPU time to zero.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists in the same place for a while. it is intended to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain-Injury Syndrome) and any mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse hover holds a while in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain associated with the use of your computer may also be caused by the use of your mouse if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click once you briefly interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Submit is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & mousetool, waiting for the mouse button down before releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving mouse button in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">Is this function enabled, creates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool; the first time it is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can click & kde; to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there's a slider Sound Buffers, which you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the last user press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be turned off at first. if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roller. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of the cmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & cmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keystrokes. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent pushing, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but it will probably cause you problems. here are some advices:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using & kmousetool; use it as follows: at the one end of the text area, press a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this is done every time & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed down a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts with smart move. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for the X Window needs to be installed, which should be the case for most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer disappears. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that a drag process starts before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dragging with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News has the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text read on a web page, you can go with & kmouth; notifications are also messages. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you receive from the carton card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & ktts; just reading such a screen, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String inserters replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string eraser filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a more intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in & ktts; include some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in the SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the map player, you can read text from KDE news about it. sieh. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will not be passed on to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent to ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not checked and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the next setup dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern for the creation of string replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the given applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is available with the qdbus program; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. words must be delimited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can paste it in the Add or Edit Pane; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the cunutils package.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. but it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility need to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a particular speaker, which is set up on the map, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text passed to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker will send the text to & ktts by means of the speaker features that the program sends, and the properties of the speakers set up on the map card. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To get faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions described above, the speaker is selected that best matches the desired requirements. click the button on the right to show the dialog language selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the Diesen filter box if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The speech output API, from & kde; with which programmers can give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, which uses the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so & ktts; this synthesizer can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a brief description of the & kde; -DBus; -interface of the speech output API in & kde; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>
<seg id="2661">Applications require voice output services via the & dbus; -interface of & kde; from the kttsd program to the object KSpeech.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Text of the text for reading and option is a language code like & eg; en, de & etc;</seg>
<seg id="2663">There are more commands you can use. for a list of all commands, enter</seg>
<seg id="2664">Open two & Console; windows. only start kttsd in one window, then kttsmgr in the other.</seg>
<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned speech synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Umformerfilter, but when using the module for festival pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone to make sable at all. you must also do that if you do not use this voice for reading websites. make sure that the program is installed xsltproc and can be found above the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors in the synthesizer, so that entire propositions are skipped or only Kauderwelsch is spent. what can I do against it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be fixed by a string replacement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer which can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. also check the ktts website for information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand for use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and to compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later), including the kdelibs packages and the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you get the source code from & ktts; get from the source code archive for cdedd or have downloaded the tarball currently generated every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, first check whether speech patchers work correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the Shellscript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the program, which uses the speech-Dispatcher program. the kttmsgr program should be developed in such a way that the speech-dispensing tool is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken into single sentences. the user can go back, repeat, pause, pause, or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application contains text at & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, look at.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Adorator on the Add button, and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the map manager device will be shown. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details about the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is handed over to festival. in case of votes you are familiar with, this setting will be done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These sliders allow you to adjust volume, voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display them grey, the voice you select does not allow these settings to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory usage).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window of kttsmgr is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the symbol kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the symbol in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as the TTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the precisely machined set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map player.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Using the buttons in this row, you can pre-select or return in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK all changes to the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and kttsmgr is reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aCode should be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here. see also</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaker speed here. 50. 50% corresponds to about half and 200mm, for example the double normal voice speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out which device works with you. in doubt, select Default.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card, you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four kinds of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of Screen Reader has been read, the queued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News has the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you & eg; just reading a long text on a web page, you can go with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and screen readers to be interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; to read Knotfy messages, start kttsmgr and click alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Tick this check box to enable reading & kde; if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktts; reads no notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, alerts for which a sound is played are from & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains marks for controlling voice, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">"[CDATA [&lt;? XML version =" 1.0 "encoding =" UTF-8 "? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / synthesis.dtd" &gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mom Bär. who slept in my bed? asked the Bärenkind.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and set limit detection filter (SDB filter) .SBDs duplicate text into single sentences. this can make & ktts faster, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically as default. you can change its settings or add more set limit recognition filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the speaker selection and select text to read. click on the map menu, which speaker & ktts; select. to do this, you will need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text orders on the map sheet, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the standard set limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filter matching text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tabulation mark (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit recognition filter keeps the character set aside.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages, warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you removed the normal statute limit filter by default, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"" "on the" "" "tab" "" "menu option, you can override the speaker settings for the application." ""</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the carton card speaker). in other words, no speaking characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker that has all the properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise, select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selections.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as the primary feature. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the area speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker selection button and then use the speaker that best matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I do not get trace tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and ktts; it was completed. you probably need to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x, the command queue-register-0.8 is probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall the Streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, freeze & ktts; a. on the & console; appears a message stating: unusable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you will find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals, add the new voice. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the file & URL, where you found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card card, there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable through the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for speaker devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the voice speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Disactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML transducer filter, and set up the speed of speaking.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. thus, festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects converting SSML to Saber the GENDER-tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a string of string erector filter and now I can do it in & ktts; I can no longer presume or return. on the track record orders will be shown, the job exists only from one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for punctuation detection.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by calling GStreamer in & ktts; call the command-register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system is also included, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freeze if you have a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you have a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general adjustment of the voice speed but is otherwise not absolutely necessary. Debian users can then install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded and ktts; as tarball (with tar-packed archive), login as a normal user and unpack the tarball to a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a run-time dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is revealed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding such as koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and usage of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which enables administration of network interfaces, routing, and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings using a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in the & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.com; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, thus & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed for installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and the Releasestand. by marking the setting non-recursively the setting can be set permanently. next start of network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter the system administrator mode at the right lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the Network Interface network:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... in the dialog Device can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are executed for the system at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual selection Manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or disabled depending on your needs. switching on an outdated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or switched off. off-off of an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The host name resolution calculator allows an easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS records can be ranked by selecting an entry or up or downgrading in the list with the Buttons Up or Down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list especially known calculator describes hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting, if no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains a list of particularly well-known machines, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add... The Add New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particularly well-known computer from the list and select Edit... The dialog box to edit is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can perform one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of the static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network settings module are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf are discussed; configurable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found any great distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description concentrates on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in external networks, at the & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address is 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so it won't be surprised if there is no other content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSE. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the capability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking. the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; hops the band back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. detects & kdat; don't know if the tape is on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the preview, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the icon for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry details of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before casting the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape is loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape from & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use data to save data. if your tape drive requires a tape to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape from & kdat; Floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity moves & kdat; proceed with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost in the process! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the backup files. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog box will be backed up. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click in any of the archives and select the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears to check. this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives associated with the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Restore menu in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog appears for restoration. in this dialog, you can re-check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will restart. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmited & kdat; before the tape is included, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the tape drive at the tape drive. it may not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the tape is automatically discarded when releasing the integration of & kdat; do not use this option with Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be directly edited with & GNU, tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; ist ein & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog, experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; hence, attempts to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystem log; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. if you don't see this, and it opens instead of a small message window, you will probably not have started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the directory / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion, or according to set strings. in the default setting, the list of log rows will be changed automatically, so that only the log rows will be displayed. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the column process, and additionally, in the filter bar, indicate the name of a process, so you will show you & ksystem log; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important minutes lines. log lines of step errors are indicated with a more eye-catching color than log lines of level indication. the colored representation of log lines can be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option To jump to new lines in the main window context menu, in order to display all the new log lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows you to view multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You can find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named as well) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for program start-ups when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to run when you boot the system or when switching to another running level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">The rc.local should be included in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most of the systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something when you boot, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by relaunching the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts from hand to command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the file contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start of the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Running levels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveling or modify the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere. this will only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to copy them only to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has existed previously in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runthouses, and now the machine starts to reboot. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start the single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default Running level to a reasonable value (3 should be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please refer to the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply complete without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the Running level so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation from & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made changes you need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save in File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled wildcards (quota) for users, a card card will be created, where you can configure individual settings. other flashcards will appear if Shadow Passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management card will appear if Shadow Passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card-card only appears if for at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the array filesystem with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The carton map groups inform about the group dependencies of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Field Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group functions analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change the boot password, change time to boot from the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
