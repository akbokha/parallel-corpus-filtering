although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain , as one says so nicely .
he says precisely what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won at the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by the candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tru@@ mps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , Tru@@ mps In@@ tolerance has been struggling for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me much in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can candidate , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates in@@ capacity to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom the majority are white voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note ) : much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wh@@ ites against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mps , there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , could have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mps Land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what does the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero have in common in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close relationship with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 miles south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimpse of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ cias O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village conveniently located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez began to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chá@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , re@@ members the initial period :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra , playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about 1 billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with an inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it explored the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly upset and reluct@@ ant to welcome a criminal offen@@ ders on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and even through the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news to suspi@@ cious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas . it is also possible to discover suspi@@ cious driving routes - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a catch licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , losing eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters every year .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among them also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licence papers , speci@@ fying fan@@ tasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; use specifically the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ volati@@ le organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found refuge boats .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be scann@@ ed by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single trace@@ able vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing where - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to face consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board where they were prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces to join the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting for illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the goal of bringing even more of such initiatives and structures into other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .

road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had rejected Venezuela &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into empt@@ iness , gathering itself on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central North @-@ lying Bun@@ de@@ state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and earnings are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round Table of Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators called on to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration in the course of the action programme &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26th October .

&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images , which tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government , according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t carry skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic shows the level of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from its point of view , has made little effort against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was initially published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Córdoba city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was ok .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , you don &apos;t realize that you are being manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis didn &apos;t have a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department of La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

archive recording .
this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
bear in mind that they will not escape you one day and I will have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argentina Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything .

&apos;@@ When the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cut in and saw a couch that men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound there .
she un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound and band@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked human beings were lying down with the face - all were tied up by hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed .
( according to information from survivors , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , runs through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they were to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military code , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have fallen into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called me a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Krimin@@ ellen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who handle cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a roll scra@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally testified against my own father .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
for crimes against humanity , 43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ ances .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a place of remembrance , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , in the last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind legs &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a native of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also responsible for the local newspapers .
the published daily paper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gramm@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correc@@ tions ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News deals with the phenomenon of &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who have been involved in accidents throughout the country is quite a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the above named re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which shows which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ y against older drivers :
the article on the translation error on Yahoo , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ind@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are numerous .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , which may produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have a foreign staff , nevertheless allow translations to be made in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made for a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints often embell@@ ished with T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least be harmless as jewellery . however , by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more resp@@ ectable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surf ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups opposed to the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
services such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission on Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closing if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to inquiries of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds bu@@ ggy or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who presented the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was detained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other people who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Global Vo@@ ices published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating from university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ m@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money transfers its under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be canc@@ eled .
the practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of both boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ m@@ ta guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the faith that they conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which occurs in the seclu@@ sion in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ta at the home of the former military member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Fer@@ rei@@ ra arrived at the end of January 2016 with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ m@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; to be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; reported Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ ad@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the Every@@ day of a Cri@@ m@@ ta
the cri@@ m@@ ots are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was part of the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the owner of the Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters feared that they would lose the education they had enabled them to lose .
but you were fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón area .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors of the ad cre@@ pt once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ adel@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , who had to pay tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the women of Guar@@ ani and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) and the system of Mens@@ ú ( in which the workers had to pay tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bill dra@@ fts Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if he fails to do so , this could result in a sentence of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application running through the Internet and being used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the ministry of telecommunic@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of these , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Research Methods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that , as they viol@@ ently control physical and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , that means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and this means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a criminal off@@ ence against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq from war

this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey .
why is this specific nature of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore establishes that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera @-@ all , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protected zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an area will be established .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , in charge of Nor@@ theast Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a commune of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring frac@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local perspective , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress made six years after it to rebuild the lives of local residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of the affected persons themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ees from the House of Beh@@ em@@ bran@@ ce were still endeav@@ our@@ ing to reloc@@ ate into final replacement homes .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ees , which were hau@@ led after the disaster , were reloc@@ ated to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 1,@@ 0@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic incident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian countries .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma again .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farming land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far from beaten .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population preparing for the next big earthquake ?
in order to as@@ certain an overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated ones . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her empi@@ ric@@ ism had changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .

as it relates to those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement homes .
as of 2017 , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ates are older than 50 years old . they are known to be older than 50 years old . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games planned to take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we are looking at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music re@@ members their affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was admitted to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana . nation@@ ally , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a hammer . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are hur@@ rying to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was a suppor@@ ter of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in his face .
police traffic gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday , brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators came .
police officers used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for or@@ ators .
the MEPs Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped road protests by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agonist : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window in order to make their photo gallery illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special case .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , almost hundreds of sugar cane plants in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of people Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as El Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its assets , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back into operation , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alled exactly that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane mill , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old path of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations agriculture and food organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the years that followed , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said that it was not one of them that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full time working group .
before the first release , the first letters began to come .
it was originally written documents which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane mill closed , or better said than they began to protest , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests carry a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to the old soldier , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ iling person , yet he does not forgive the lies that he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years old in retirement , not because he lacks power but because he is bit@@ tern@@ ess .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of traveling workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders mobile recording studios run directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lived in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars together .
the workshop raises awareness that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ al@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a stretch of road in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song Wh@@ Ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the page page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ za is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if nobody is ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and continue our youth as well .
this is how they can do what they have intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the stan@@ za to Sil@@ en@@ ille ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic Cour@@ ts ( 5 @-@ 5 @-@ 8 people ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they will be displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the map , &quot; Plastic model of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic courts and then decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a multitude of small businesses producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courts are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them . a new trend , however , turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets nowadays .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone tape decorated with plastic courts , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for your mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ bil@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more bizarre plastic dishes you can see yourself at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 , but the number # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics only . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident no one looks at the gri@@ eving or the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each corp@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were caught in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ die que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret tom@@ bs to his son .
or Emma V@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves for the task we asked ourselves to go and search for graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma V@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter in what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass every day to newspaper readers and see the front pages with pictures , which are actually only from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different to it or consider this to be normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is large . and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ iled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t stir and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital city district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats . &quot; in this she describes how an armed criminals report money from their business until they end up destroying not only the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Civil Coun@@ cill@@ or for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor declared 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 acres a day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; in 2015 , animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of meti@@ culous coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our cra@@ ving for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus rav@@ aged . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically one of the tan@@ ker lor@@ ries fell victim to death .
authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the football World Cup .
houses of br@@ ushed and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture titled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nigeria communities of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dr@@ astically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops burned down and corp@@ ses lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be visu@@ alised figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further brings personal comments like this example wrong@@ ly the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a manifest@@ o , published by the United Nations described those who could flee be@@ atings , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arabic news page , wrong@@ ly claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other intelligence agencies , which called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ sions reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures with 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed @-@ mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ a@@ yed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of what they have been published on . thus , we want to show the reach more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which may also be linked to each other in some cases ) , there may be several examples of impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in Orange ) :

the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .

as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to show his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo has been shared as evidence of B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ings in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to off@@ end the claims made by Roh@@ ing@@ ya , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government issued a statement of what it meant as &quot; intentionally dark news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of od@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a isch@@ a@@ emia thri@@ ller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site , wrong@@ ly , claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published on the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , released today , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bla@@ sts , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and ret@@ we@@ ets more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the message in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original version of 2010 , the picture may finally bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
there are tens of people with social media who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and bel@@ lows the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the pre@@ valence of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal contem@@ plates to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images demon@@ ize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media react to helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with violent representation in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any examination of incorrect attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unmistak@@ able words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find e.g. words from the VAT @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ l@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - paint your parents in recognition of how they have tried to have you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have been war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ rau@@ d other cultures , reveal other thoughts of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these unmistak@@ able words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are greatly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually begins at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ whale and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have res@@ igned in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri Lanka disaster center , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe where@@ ab@@ outs .
the rainf@@ alls took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on its way .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of yesterday &apos;s over@@ tro@@ dden water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five will be completed for the transportation of emergency supplies for the residents locked in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Chal@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us today number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) call @-@ call app asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ ast@@ oph@@ oria data center is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a S@@ OS button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring citizens in need for security and help those in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka being im@@ minent the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter ; she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next week we will set up rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslims ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they had to lim@@ p me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , are not Muslim .
reli@@ eving the muscles
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace of mind ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this dele@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting pic@@ torial language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these pictures continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who carry out movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans that were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ fut@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ fut@@ able Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the pick@@ pockets with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a theological expert to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by the current volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic precision machinery with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we talk about it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger dra@@ gging a woman &apos;s veil .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they fall back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my neighbour , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter if I held her in my arms , and she would whis@@ per the Arabic verses for protection that seal the Quran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

authorized to use .
belonging to me is the image of my grandmother in the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as they gain for decades a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means speaking the prayers that she had told me to speak if I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire &quot; which a company formed with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
authorized to use .
belonging to him means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ m@@ ir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century into his arms .
belonging to it is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; to four Muslim lands .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I was ever , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ cann@@ y history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went into Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the suspect has a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer request , the az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties provided with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fails to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reduced novel@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility to this two .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it exists in continuous surveillance of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that en@@ closes its limits to people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ding it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we wage and the bombs we drop in Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically un@@ true picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous pic@@ torial forms that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editors .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to demonstrate the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them , now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me become an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to &quot; others . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks@@ site of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; will be enth@@ ron@@ ed in public imagination , four decades ago was himself a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other . &quot; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , is bombar@@ ding chocolate cake while he has already broken countries and &quot; home made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban languages
story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ passed blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , historians tell their story first and foremost in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and presentation make the audience aware of it .
they call out laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fa@@ bel of h@@ are and b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico calls for rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ation of sovereign debt by the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march was launched by the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital &apos;s government building , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; Front for the Neur@@ onal Ex@@ ams ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a steering committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed salary which corresponds to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deter@@ red by falling pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island - not an inherent sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ party non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on national responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on the outside will risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open grid .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event was devoted to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ing de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Refle@@ ction ) .
the book published last year and available roy@@ alty @-@ free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost associated with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; Military Tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tide &apos;s cultural prototypes were more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started this work , the IS would put everything in place , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun@@ n@@ ily , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting , a commission which she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
cover of Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is done &quot; :
it happens at each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your lovely eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words ;
that I wear with passion ,
when your eyes are saying goodbye
and let me leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : convic@@ ted of corruption sentenced to previous post due to corruption
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants on account of the mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
in 2016 Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement from the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his former position , as the firm did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his sentence .
however , many inhabitants do not call the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the Director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the offen@@ ding .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not cause any appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , likewise dec@@ lines this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been approved .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradictory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the Director has no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison :
thi@@ eves are in Pr@@ ison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he confirmed energe@@ tically that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also neg@@ ating :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spl@@ inters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or it was a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely de@@ preci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically create hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts tagged with the use of the word or doubt have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; as follows :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the questioning ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before removing all the posts that are suspected of racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I posted a post to tell my friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not correspon@@ de to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than concentrating on code and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ capable age is now 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a big public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because that , when age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; every person under the age of 18 years &quot; are defined .
UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws for the marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . doub@@ tless they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children &apos;s marriage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should , themselves dam@@ ned , take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children was decided - despite four Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle has posted to Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it .
after having previously been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ enden news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amendment to the Act was adopted today , 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 dep@@ uties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # Ali@@ vesti@@ ture abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj had to act against the law , most social media users would wish to address the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ c@@ rell suggested :
rather , Sat , if we , instead of discussing so general , in a way that can only cause panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply say that the state , our daughters , will protect that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled women who are in front of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the marriage is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday morning , the office of the prosec@@ utor gave Y@@ ar@@ News the local news service that they were hack@@ ed .
thanks to the mirr@@ oring of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia &apos;s content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obs@@ cured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has closed the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking items from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
in spite of legal prohibition , the content is irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to lay sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentr@@ alised and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia sites , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as collabor@@ ators with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to sn@@ ore pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s natural environment and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing in face to face to Tig@@ ers , saying ,
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
I too was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately starts to look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ach@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a pseudo dish from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after she had appe@@ aled to a married relative with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main tal@@ k@@ ative theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ pl@@ al campaign , which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working with her video camera for seven years on the cover of practices such as child marriage and exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they are all du@@ tiful and have never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this is considered to be dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we have never thought about this until this round of discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long while after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want us , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ de in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women are never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she could only secure herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole bunch of frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in rush hour about having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women up@@ side down : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ o @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ o @-@ red dot if he did it .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying it .
the other women have not ceased completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say something loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ eh @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the benefits of choosing a dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of tas ( shirts ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it .
on the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far we have only made small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and are no other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos;s official YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was a living room with a living room in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter @-@ Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through .
the people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! but today is the Beat@@ les memorial in Japan . it was here in Tokyo before 51 years ago .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went to London on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan@@ base in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mt . Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going to be .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
photo : anders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ trafficking , probably for religious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the Mala@@ wi@@ an border .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia explained the BBC .
it is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in the South African country to conduct a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique travel bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ bands Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the deaths of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for thought @-@ off rituals , has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that there exists a faith , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches generated .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the Chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed A land in which people would be ashamed to demand sex for good marks , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for religious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve rapid fortune .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the leader of the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are familiar :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald men .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt sympathy towards his family , his friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meeting in the Arabian B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who claimed themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay tribute to Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the start of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the terminal .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; sub@@ version , &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family .
they should be able to meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June the news agency AF@@ P that the embassy asked Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the U.S. embassy asked for an angry response from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the United States
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had major concerns over whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada in the United States
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police are always monitoring the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o ob@@ tains all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he is . furthermore , his wife and his family shall have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France would ultimately accept it .
Taiwan Association of Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cc were not very pos@@ eless : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies at the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam .
he disgu@@ ised these questions with non @-@ answers of a rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to express his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to enligh@@ ten this point , provided that it was paid highly to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the criti@@ ques that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck could be better understood , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said .
at least I knew with Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old guard who was expecting me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ solves the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credited a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered to be an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister have to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink human identity ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dates to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I then answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
then most of the time my clari@@ fication follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans might still cook in rage if they are held for Americans but doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small ap@@ hor@@ n@@ leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you would conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; basically means being di@@ ligent , like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things happening around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders refer to as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about the regulations his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military su@@ prem@@ acy of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , even Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular the situation of the country under the rule of the Jun@@ ta .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ic paragraph 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute decision power over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change the attitudes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered to be critics of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content was monitored and persons accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the monarchy was prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; Lot &apos;s Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Supp@@ lement ) .
martial law was declared in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; which had already been used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al have striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sh@@ an @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s called Chr@@ u@@ sche@@ uk@@ ho@@ kas are symboli@@ cal for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and they are rarely occupied by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all ministered to the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden ourselves to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the ruined building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get through the laps .
in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll grow up cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; call A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll grow up cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time , she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation approaches the end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy follows him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children is now scre@@ aming the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ ying buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide in@@ security in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; shel@@ ters migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and appears here with kind permission .
on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ene base and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people get in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy medication they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil already , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy got weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for several months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers still consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about the fact that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she lam@@ bs in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of U@@ rum@@ qi have received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web purification &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , it was clear that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; damaging information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors &quot; filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet , based on Twitter , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile phone notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are accidentally discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment with the transfer technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
in addition , &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( near Schw@@ einf@@ urt ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; in the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and find that you are alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from within and from outside .
one that honor her name .
one who breaks down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality catches you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters in nature turn out of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt resol@@ ves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service wor@@ ded - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts of the city sought , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice res@@ ound through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a splendid picture , full of my expectations .
in such a moment you become aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit out of the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you cried out all the way to the office of the Security Service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me also hear you shout &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; or you are brave enough to shout when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look at me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pres@@ ume all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested way of communication : hitting the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my T@@ ellen@@ gen@@ osse was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ generation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
a liar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ori@@ ze at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them shout &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light , which presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ rement to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they spoke in the Alban@@ ian dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions of facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join these days and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become accustomed to not responding .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become a common means of communication for me .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ cks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a tr@@ ash collector , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to show us the great invention of a giant cable from their perspective .
within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice too , which is why I stopped crying out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity f@@ lowed through my entire body , enough to supply my entire district .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go back to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep you , you will move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he shu@@ d@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine fle@@ cked lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and question her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian prisoner of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water dri@@ fting Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the mu@@ zzle of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one casts a glimpse of the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ tier , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening .
the deputy and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which puts the tried and tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply rhetor@@ ic , but actually a reality that is increasingly evident in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ a &apos;s traditional sex organ by taking up his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly tro@@ mp@@ ed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ ors &apos; - the in@@ official out@@ war@@ dly .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner .
according to a crime against crime in 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically at the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse frequently repe@@ ats :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya , to later remember that his comments were torn from context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a processed version was stre@@ amed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires public opinion for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not correspon@@ ded to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ction thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is asking himself : if Abu Nu@@ a , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service arrested several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had critically comments on social media comments related to the corruption that was rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to shed and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west mar@@ ched to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the disciples , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two flo@@ ats are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall truck was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans swap weapons against sciss@@ ors and razor blades

rarely outer appearance and personal care were as important as in this story because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high rate of crime , where stre@@ aks and illegal drug dealers are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens enter the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair styles .
the unparalleled demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the match of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an education in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only technical college in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children , we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : love letter to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ chi@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this question was exactly what the Young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation left behind from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Lé@@ li@@ ación ( letter to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ illa fighters .
just recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , forming the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , who were exposed to war rhetor@@ ic and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once used to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must join together and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent response this year to share his love with people .
thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for ex @-@ fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; told the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bodi@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone wrote me something so nice , so I answer . &quot; suddenly I ran into tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net @-@ thro@@ wer .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as pre @-@ war and the F@@ ARC was already active in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC were decl@@ aring the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state looked at the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hate them , are only people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would prevail after dis@@ armament .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ anda and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , sharing some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the kidn@@ apping , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested dou@@ bt@@ ful qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew up there .
ever since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the United States in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ wife who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App did the same .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honour the family , you scar@@ let ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten all along and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called for an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which patient &apos;s wing were you laid - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ sn@@ y on official TV and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have gran@@ ular size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster that has not only damaged your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number sign with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about it , you &apos;d be safe just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you plug in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid hur@@ ting her .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself trouble to look at how the person looks out of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do to those who have remained there ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for this I needed updated information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who was in a gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end request proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not too many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put Cad@@ om@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards have grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us back to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore bead @-@ jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me only one hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace have lasted ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped onto the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before looked at you once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent on it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I r@@ ushed off breeding places .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to show you foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the Da@@ ge@@ ants who have the cab@@ in@@ ers have which , the Russians have whatever ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan , live together with men .
know , many think at transition to men who love men and they believe that you will change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship has been around for more than a year now .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian region of Ah@@ wa@@ z suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th arrested the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ deca@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he was suffering from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ deca@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution of the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , based in the Iran @-@ based Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , famine and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t the water from the Arabic areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only allowed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught in the region , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youngsters has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who have a job completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at cr@@ ushing the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to make a living outside their native country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists propose alarm , before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is in@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we ought to be all feminist in general .
for example , women earn less money nowadays in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or to black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I say how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to both sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs by means of cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . some of them continue to silence the meaning of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still remains in its name .
I prefer to completely rid myself of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ anism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of campaig@@ ning for a white @-@ feminist paradigm , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ or@@ ah Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book &quot; Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ism : &quot; rec@@ la@@ iming &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has not gone over , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community .

Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article is part of # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christ@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ree ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
a Police Com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship there has been some time passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez reported nothing .
a few days later , the second woman left her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make an advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report at all with the law enforcement authorities .
In@@ halt@@ 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 In@@ visible abuse and a judicial system that nothing subordin@@ ate to 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of implementation strikes and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ ros , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
but the numbers available are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; to every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal offen@@ se , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately demonstrate how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay for ten days because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but she still didn &apos;t want to . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most discern@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he rhetor@@ ically asked if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long ago by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen liz@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament has been discussing a draft law known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ e@@ as ( # Prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to declare that Fem@@ ini@@ d is an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish tough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to also gain the dep@@ uties for the law which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions which is currently prohibited in Paraguay must be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een that much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear in themselves , if they simply want to receive ad and receive safe accommodation , impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to allow so long ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recon@@ ci@@ liation Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; section has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article is part of # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christ@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ree ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman have continued to attack one year after bann@@ ing a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in the sul@@ tant because of their reporting on corruption .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power following his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the sole sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s reign is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , notably inland secret services , public freedoms , including freedom of the press , and to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ filtr@@ ate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 , corruption was reported in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , following an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of justice &quot; in the paper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure judges of the Supreme Court in Oman into an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS captured the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and circulation of the newspaper in any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 to $ 7@@ 800 . moreover , a one @-@ year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) following the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
he was arrested for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in the amount of 5000 Korea Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court pronounced Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also included the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper .
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ign , the newspaper is still facing attacks by the Cuban government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information received an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continued closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has recently been viol@@ ated in Oman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further violations include closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Cuban authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) challenges the Cuban authorities :
1 . un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. to create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ imp@@ eded their ri@@ ghtful human rights work , without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is seldom or not even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment to explore these diseases by pharmaceutical firms are a major problem .
secondly , research undertaken by African scientists itself helps build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home in order to support the Sam@@ ba health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be the recipient instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salad sorts he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on species . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but he now needs longer , since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I must yo@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand firm , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the U.S. and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman Sal@@ ad of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variety of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , briefly referred to as Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , to breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately identify - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection .
seeds also play a role in larger contexts , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of crops could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry . &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to remaining freely available to others . this means that their approach is to patent seeds and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed , as the available gene pool due to increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited , is constantly shr@@ inking .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all car@@ rot features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a matter of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they are specifically desired traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as climate change conditions are far less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four Gen@@ B@@ anks and cooperation with institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not hin@@ der innovations , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants adapted to the changed environment conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , the main reason for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the whole Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , Plant breeders in O@@ reg@@ on and Os@@ si board members , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; anyone who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for which they are needed mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without surviving patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mort@@ on also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , carries out an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agre@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
one explanation , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; open source seed systems &apos; programme , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be the official start of the official start next year .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on that .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
Arabic Network for Human Rights Issu@@ es - in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law should expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , and even if it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

alongside AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he did not write accessible web pages and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship was even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also is given a home blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him :
having blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blog is perhaps not significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , blocking of blogs and any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after locking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way through to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers , through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis , with which they can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants quar@@ rel .

day after day , newspapers all over Brazil report with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air tea to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violence threshold in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO , Global Justice , even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision as follows :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who first shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira contradic@@ ts violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in her view , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ paid neglect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro says : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to the statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state .
this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost glob@@ es . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week since the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ et@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident struck head@@ lines : a fruit sellers died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : revi@@ ved Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where a chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have stood under siege outside of Damascus , which led to the need for local residents to be smu@@ g@@ gled through tunnels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics are teaching the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as as they can plant their own mushrooms as a food source .
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only a rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Di@@ re@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years it has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ ang@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ us seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire spreading in the country &apos;s northern and central regions , reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread across the network and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the Saturday protests was to call for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Bund der farmers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far reaching proposal on the reform of the forest in 2003 and 2005 by the government was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val explains in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread like in a vi@@ cious circle .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , as inhabitants requested information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the application of its own civil protection data with the help of the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was crucial that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website numbered more than half a million acc@@ esses .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban and a lot of Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ pen found herself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at the time , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ pen rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ pen left his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities refused to apply for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high rates of afford@@ ability , Italy is a kind of second chance for expi@@ red asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the civil rights organisation &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only then be assigned to a recording centre if they formally put an application to asylum , which can still be applied for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then there are people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ pen to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after several years of construction work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ pen inserted his entire savings to the creation of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ pen Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans run business , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s destinations extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ pen with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ pen also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; this is how they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ pen has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws enable elimination of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Ah@@ mad Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ eds report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of receiving the law decision on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the un@@ si@@ ghting of a pen@@ al payment .
the Act , which was promoted by 60 Members of Parliament , is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further MP submitted a legislative proposal introducing more severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the law proposition , such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ts .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( aka Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a court appointment .
recently , his hear@@ ings were postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is facing the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , mock loading of , among other things , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad@@ al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ ro@@ gated documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a suspended action plan . said plan was provided by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supported a controversial draft bill that would ins@@ ure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all funds obtained illeg@@ ally .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the President &apos;s plans to support the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined to mention his sources under article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on 9 May .
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
according to new regulations of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the provisions that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that by doing so , the elimination of anonymous comments on social networks should be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to be held responsible for removing content and to comp@@ el them on request for the termination of user data .
these web pages include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ wick@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block@@ ade of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that works with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance events that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install web browsers that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation takes place until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
