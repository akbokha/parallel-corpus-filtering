<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain, as one says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says precisely what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won at the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by the candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, Trumps Intolerance has been struggling for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican candidate, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates incapacity to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom the majority are white voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(note): much like" "" "the Whites against all the other ethnicities" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White Americas of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, could have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "screaming the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later, he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero have in common in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close relationship with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 miles south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimpse of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village conveniently located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chavez began to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers the initial period:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra, playing instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about 1 billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with an inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it explored the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly upset and reluctant to welcome a criminal offenders on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries which are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and even through the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news to suspicious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas. it is also possible to discover suspicious driving routes - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a catch licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay for punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, losing eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters every year.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among them also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "use specifically the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-volatile organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You mustn't run my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found refuge boats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps track down the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross this," "" "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be scanned by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single traceable vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing where - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without a license and hardly had to face consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board where they were prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we have become a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces to join the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting for illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the goal of bringing even more of such initiatives and structures into other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under a false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North-lying Bundestate Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current president Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the secrecy of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and earnings are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was initially published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Córdoba city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano is now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, you don't realize that you are being manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis didn't have a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department of La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="347">In Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, in the last month witnessed a particularly mischievous translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word (koreidossha), which means "older motorists" means falsely - but perhaps also with malicious hind legs & # 8212; as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a native of Kyotos. he was also responsible for the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The published daily paper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the incorrect English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" older drivers "" ""). "" "</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate corrections (translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News deals with the phenomenon of "dreadful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who have been involved in accidents throughout the country is quite a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are numerous.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, which may produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have a foreign staff, nevertheless allow translations to be made in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made for a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordings in Japan, including the puzzling imprints often embellished with T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least be harmless as jewellery. however, by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more respectable source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surf) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups opposed to the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Services such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission on Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closing if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online broadcasters. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to inquiries of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds buggy or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who presented the protests in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by Global Voices published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating from university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "he who has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a crimta for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a big family with little money transfers its underage son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of both boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the crimta guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the faith that they conclude their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl with her and justifies its exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which occurs in the seclusion in the Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of severe beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadta at the home of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">Ferreira arrived at the end of January 2016 with a stick on Marín, until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they called the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and called for "no further Carolina" to be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," reported Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to infringe the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Everyday of a Crimta</seg>
<seg id="455">The crimots are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the horrendous Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific nature of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore establishes that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera-all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, in charge of Northeast Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a commune of prefectures in Japan's north-east, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring fractures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local perspective, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress made six years after it to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of the affected persons themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuees from the House of Behembrance were still endeavouring to relocate into final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees, which were hauled after the disaster, were relocated to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1,074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic incident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agrarian countries.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farming land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far from beaten.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population preparing for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to ascertain an overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated ones. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her empiricism had changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it relates to those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuates from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima are still living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas, most of the evacuates are older than 50 years old. they are known to be older than 50 years old. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games planned to take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we are looking at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherita explains how the love of music remembers their affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was admitted to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Goiana. nationally, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now have put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a hammer. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he strikes in Goiana with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the whole oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralador," a media channel of media activists from Goiana, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are hurrying to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also dipped in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he was a supporter of the Occupy movement in secondary schools, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stick in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police traffic grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday, brutal police operations against demonstrators came.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers used rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for orators.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MEPs Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loud speakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have slipped road protests by focusing on another, unexpected protagonist: a windscreen.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window in order to make their photo gallery illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special case.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title of "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso Act, almost hundreds of sugar cane plants in Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of people Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as El Central - in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its assets, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back into operation, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalled exactly that Mañalich would get the sugar cane mill, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old path of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural perspectives" published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations agriculture and food organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around $85 million for the country.</seg>

<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the years that followed, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>

<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats the most," "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said that it was not one of them that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first release, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was originally written documents which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important worktop producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut's speech of October 21, 2002, the former President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane mill closed, or better said than they began to protest, they also stopped to asphalve the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without prospects for the future, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production does not even serve to supply the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016 Nene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Ninety-nine harvests carry a pension of two thousand peso per month to the old soldier, to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with few teeth and clear voice, is not a trailing person, yet he does not forgive the lies that he told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been torturing him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is about 65 years old in retirement, not because he lacks power but because he is bitterness.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this through Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders mobile recording studios run directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges who lived in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop raises awareness that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a stretch of road in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song WhApmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the page page of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody is ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and continue our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they have intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and proponent of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and adds the stanza to Silenille (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they will be displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the map, "Plastic model of the dishes") of each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic courts and then decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a multitude of small businesses producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courts are usually that they don't even notice them. a new trend, however, turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone tape decorated with plastic courts, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for your mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onibili), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes you can see yourself at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag # 2, but the number # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. for example, with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics only. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident no one looks at the grieving or the communities who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were caught in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidie que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changed" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret tombs to his son.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper readers and see the front pages with pictures, which are actually only from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent to it or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is large. and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soiled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they don't stir and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the capital city district: how a family was pillaged with threats." in this she describes how an armed criminals report money from their business until they end up destroying not only the business, but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and "chi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Civil Councillor for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor declared 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 acres a day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," in 2015, animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of meticulous coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our craving for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus ravaged. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically one of the tanker lorries fell victim to death.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses of brushed and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "This is Nigeria." the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigeria communities of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops burned down and corpses lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be visualised figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documenting assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "another step further brings personal comments like this example wrongly the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments." ""</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a manifesto, published by the United Nations described those who could flee beatings, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of improper use of the image from DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and, on the other hand, the attempt of a blogger to offend the claims made by Rohingya, since the photos were misused.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar government issued a statement of what it meant as "intentionally dark news and photos that came to international media, international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create misunderstandings with respect to Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This rectification, which was published exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of odors that Hate Speech operates and used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "Russia, 2012." "" "a ischaemia thriller" "" "(Christianophobia or political provocation?)." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox community, makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news site, wrongly, claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published on the news page Análisis Digital, released today, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar" jihadist attack. "</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later came into circulation in the context of the Boko Haram massacre, the El Pais newspaper tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria blasts, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, provided with this Twitterhashtag, triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre (and retweets more than 9,300 times), but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly written by a "father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnamese and declared it a false message.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the image of the DR Congo was included, the organization of the Claretiner missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distanced himself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, generators and sites in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey) Tineye also points out, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original version of 2010, the picture may finally bear a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are tens of people with social media who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and bellows the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The prevalence of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal contemplates to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images demonize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media react to helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with violent representation in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used from the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of incorrect attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. untranslatable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find e.g. words from the VAT-lap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglk" "" "- paint your parents in recognition of how they have tried to have you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after you have been warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defraud other cultures, reveal other thoughts of thought and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these unmistakable words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floodwater and landslide catastrophe this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually begins at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwhale and Attanagalu Oya have resigned in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to an opinion of the Sri Lanka disaster center, on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls took place on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flooding in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to flood situations.</seg>

<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations, and another five will be completed for the transportation of emergency supplies for the residents locked in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and start-ups have also agreed to help.</seg>

<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They had to limp me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not look all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, as I do not fit into it, are not Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Relieving the muscles</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western conception the religion of Rumis was extinguished, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades, while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and erroneously that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1,7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives that help us understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassed blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening" "" "is often associated with understanding" "" "purpose these events instead" "" "listen to feel, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historians tell their story first and foremost in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and presentation make the audience aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call out laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fabel of hare and baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story-telling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march was launched by the Mexican Capitol, the capital's government building, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda (Citizens "Front for the Neuronal Exams) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open grid.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event was devoted to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available royalty-free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost associated with it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" Military Tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as an inside of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastide's cultural prototypes were more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started this work, the IS would put everything in place, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"" "" "" "funnily, Bassel could not finish this project yet." ""</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting, a commission which she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: convicted of corruption sentenced to previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of the misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In 2016 Cambaza was released for good lead and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement from the Attorney General's Attorney of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his former position, as the firm did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, abbreviated CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the Director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the offending.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not cause any appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, likewise declines this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil, says the Director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind a thief in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are in Prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he confirmed energetically that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or it was a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically create hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts tagged with the use of the word or doubt have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the questioning (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before removing all the posts that are suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I posted a post to tell my friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "did not corresponde to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to increase their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heighten violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than concentrating on code and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were eager to abolish laws for the marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. doubtless they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the" "" "children's marriage" "", "they should, themselves damned, take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated situation, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children was decided - despite four Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle has posted to Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthralled because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who dresses a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the thing, but do you know what? the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>

<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment to the Act was adopted today, 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al-wi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj had to act against the law, most social media users would wish to address the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worcrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, Sat, if we, instead of discussing so general, in a way that can only cause panic and displeasure, if we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply say that the state, our daughters, will protect that they may be abused by large, hard-boiled women who are in front of them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the marriage is legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Thanks to the mirroring of web pages, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia's content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has closed the popular encyclopedia of Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking items from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">In spite of legal prohibition, the content is irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (via the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to lay snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentralised and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia sites, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiknopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigiri - Global Voices Member as well as collaborators with Mozilla in the Panigrai's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">An exuberant rhinoceros, chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to carry a camera and try to straighten up the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, gives him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was located and I immediately started to snore pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's natural environment and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing in face to face to Tigers, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I too was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately starts to look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyacha and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of consequences, they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a pseudo dish from the Indian State of Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after she had appealed to a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main talkative theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # Khelplal campaign, which is run by the Video Volunteers community and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paste has been working with her video camera for seven years on the cover of practices such as child marriage and exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which Rohini showed in its discussion round, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands out loud is a custom that they are all dutiful and have never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this is considered to be deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply entrenched that we have never thought about this until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long while after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want us, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohde in Maharashtra, about breaking a centuries-old tradition where married women are never allowed to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she could only secure herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole bunch of frustrations against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in rush hour about having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women upside down: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zino-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zino-red dot if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped carrying it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say something loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Saleh-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the benefits of choosing a dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of tas (shirts) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "so far we have only made small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and are no other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the Beatles's official YouTube channel.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was a living room with a living room in the japanese Twitter-Trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language as English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! but today is the Beatles memorial in Japan. it was here in Tokyo before 51 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went to London on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies use the fanbase in terms of market technology, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could it be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat Ramen noodles at Mt. Koya." ""</seg>
<seg id="1579">That is how the day is going to be.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trafficking, probably for religious purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the Malawian border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">According to the local superstitions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia explained the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN in the South African country to conduct a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who are planning to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique travel bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Muslim police according to the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husbands Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the deaths of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for thought-off rituals, has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that there exists a faith, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches generated.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the Chronicle of the blogger Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambique, THE SME ashamed A land in which people would be ashamed to demand sex for good marks, and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald-headed for religious purposes or "black magic" are hunted, which aim to achieve rapid fortune.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the leader of the district of Morrumbala, Pedro Sange and the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, both are familiar:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "subversion," following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China referred Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman says he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to elevate all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should be able to meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad shared that the Americans" "" "wish him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad so far as he can help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June the news agency AFP that the embassy asked Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The U.S. embassy asked for an angry response from China, with the statement of the State Department that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany and the United States</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope Liu will receive "all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had major concerns over whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada in the United States</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police are always monitoring the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to anyone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo obtains all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he is. furthermore, his wife and his family shall have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France would ultimately accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Association of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Liu on 27 June and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator, Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with a statement on 28 June around Liu and stated that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmucc were not very poseless: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies at the end of the last week of Shanmugam.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised these questions with non-answers of a rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to express his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to enlighten this point, provided that it was paid highly to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the critiques that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference, so that the context of the statements of Shanmuck could be better understood, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuck, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said.</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee kuan Yev and the members of the old guard who was expecting me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, correctly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review dissolves the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "credited a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered to be an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the Cabinet, statements by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister have to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "the magazine" "" "Journey of a Decade" "" "dates to Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defence of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodes the junta, which took power in 2014, and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continue to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about the regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military supremacy of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 songs.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular the situation of the country under the rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconic paragraph 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute decision power over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, the online content was monitored and persons accused of leveraging the monarchy was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict law against "Lot's Majest" (Majestic Supplement).</seg>
<seg id="1794">Martial law was declared in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillene base and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, people get in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy medication they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil already, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explained Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that the Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy got weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for several months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city is a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers still consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about the fact that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she lambs in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair stains that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi have received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, it was clear that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blocking of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors "filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet, based on Twitter, "Images from mainland China," which published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile phone notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are accidentally discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment with the transfer technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">In addition, "Images from mainland China" (near Schweinfurt) also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards" in the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he shudles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine flecked lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967; the year Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felicyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and question her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25 Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian prisoner of the second generation" - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while in water drifting Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the muzzle of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one casts a glimpse of the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputy and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which puts the tried and tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply rhetoric, but actually a reality that is increasingly evident in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib moved to Leia's traditional sex organ by taking up his vision of the fate of Arab women who had premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly tromped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honors' - the inofficial outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime against crime in 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "indefinitely be held in prison," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically at the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse frequently repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Yordanian online programme Roya, to later remember that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a processed version was streamed" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires public opinion for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not corresponded to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in recollection thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is asking himself: if Abu Nua, who was to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service arrested several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had critically comments on social media comments related to the corruption that was rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - is made up of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to shed and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many regions Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west marched to the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the disciples, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two floats are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely outer appearance and personal care were as important as in this story because they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high rate of crime, where streaks and illegal drug dealers are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens enter the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can recreate these elaborate hair styles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the match of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current contests are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an education in the hairdresser's art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only technical college in the community and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children, we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letter to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monchive.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly what the Young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation left behind from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la Léliación (letter to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), forming the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, who were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once used to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must join together and help in the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed most urgent response this year to share his love with people.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for ex-fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between," told the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambodians" "" "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone wrote me something so nice, so I answer. "suddenly I ran into tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet-thrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as pre-war and the FARC was already active in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC were declaring the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state looked at the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hate them, are only people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would prevail after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, rise and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there has not only emerged overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, sharing some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that address the kidnapping, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested doubtful queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chechens from the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>

<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to honour the family, you scarlet?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten all along and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called for an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient's wing were you laid - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grosny on official TV and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have granular size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster that has not only damaged your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with dark window panes and a number sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about it, you'd be safe just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you plug in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "" "" "however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid hurting her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give myself trouble to look at how the person looks out of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do to those who have remained there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed updated information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was in a gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end request proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put Cadomrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards have grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us back to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore bead-jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never curbed me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace have lasted?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at you once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreffs, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent on it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I rushed off breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to show you foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dageants who have the cabiners have which, the Russians have whatever; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think at transition to men who love men and they believe that you will change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship has been around for more than a year now.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27th arrested the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Mordecai was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He was suffering from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube stopped the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Mordecai was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution of the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, based in the Iran-based Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, famine and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ahwazi Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams that divert the water from the Arabic areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only allowed to aggravate the devastation caused by drought in the region, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of Ahwazis who have a job completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at crushing the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to make a living outside their native country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists propose alarm, before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is intreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay out well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we ought to be all feminist in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women earn less money nowadays in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or to black women from the Diaspora; if I say how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which relate to both sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851 Sojourner complained: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a dehumanly and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs by means of cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. some of them continue to silence the meaning of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" still remains in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to completely rid myself of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of campaigning for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clorah Hudson-Weems, the author of the book "Africana womanism:" reclaiming "(about: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they can be completely safe in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has not gone over, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article is part of # PorSerMujer (# Christlicheinefree), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A Police Commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship there has been some time passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for maltreatment, Ada Báez reported nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman left her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make an advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report at all with the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 punches and statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a judicial system that nothing subordinate to 3 Paraguayan laws: good approach, lack of implementation strikes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Egyros, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>

<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal offense, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately demonstrate how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he rhetorically asked if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long ago by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# nonEineWeniger) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to declare that Feminid is an independent criminal offence and to punish tougher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to also gain the deputies for the law which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions which is currently prohibited in Paraguay must be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen that much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must bear in themselves, if they simply want to receive ad and receive safe accommodation, impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal." ""</seg>

<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to allow so long ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more severe effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment to explore these diseases by pharmaceutical firms are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research undertaken by African scientists itself helps build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic first showed serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home in order to support the Samba health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be the recipient instead of being a creator.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make articles against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salad sorts he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton species. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but he now needs longer, since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must yodel." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand firm, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that is growing ever bigger in the U.S. and around the world: open Source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman Salad of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "variety of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "open source" seeds) is inspired by the free "open source" software, providing alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, briefly referred to as Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, to breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately identify - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also play a role in larger contexts, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of crops could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and takes on the ever-increasing mergers in the global agriculture industry. "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to remaining freely available to others. this means that their approach is to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardised, as the available gene pool due to increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited, is constantly shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carrot features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A matter of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they are specifically desired traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as climate change conditions are far less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four GenBanks and cooperation with institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not hinder innovations, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants adapted to the changed environment conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main reason for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "on the whole Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Plant breeders in Oregon and Ossi board members, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "anyone who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for which they are needed mass-wise herbicides, are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such as Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without surviving patents - either they reject the patenting or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative: "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>

<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, carries out an open-source seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Arabic Network for Human Rights Issues - in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law should expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, and even if it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of website lockings to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Alongside ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer has access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he did not write accessible web pages and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship was even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also is given a home blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Having blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blog is perhaps not significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking of blogs and any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after locking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blocking of providers, through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal basis, with which they can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army deployed in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo of: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers all over Brazil report with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "" "" "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air tea to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violence threshold in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO, Global Justice, even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists don't close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira contradicts violence as a "war." this is, in her view, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-paid neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro says: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north-east of the country according to the statistics of 2015. these are the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro State.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="2781">This security policy also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost globes."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week since the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacetzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident struck headlines: a fruit sellers died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly due to the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where a chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have stood under siege outside of Damascus, which led to the need for local residents to be smuggled through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics are teaching the inhabitants of East Ghoutas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a food source.</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only a rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direkt of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years it has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more" "" "gaining publicity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to raise money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alangda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila zu Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations from CanDo until Monday, September 4th 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of fungus seeds coming from the regions" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire spreading in the country's northern and central regions, reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been killed by the Taliban and a lot of Hazara suddenly felt safe.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharpen found herself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At the time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharpen recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharpen left his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities refused to apply for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high rates of affordability, Italy is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organisation "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centers" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only then be assigned to a recording centre if they formally put an application to asylum, which can still be applied for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharpen to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of construction work in the construction industry, Asharpen inserted his entire savings to the creation of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharpen Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans run business, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs destinations extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim to return to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," "" "says Asharpen with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharpen also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "this is how they can sell their harvest surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharpen has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp of Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Needs report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of receiving the law decision on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the unsighting of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which was promoted by 60 Members of Parliament, is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "a further MP submitted a legislative proposal introducing more severe penalties for the insult of the President or a senior official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposition, such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fines, so legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean three years "imprisonment for the convicts.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (aka Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearings were postponed to the 20th of May because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is facing the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, mock loading of, among other things, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosadal-Barbary. they were charged for reporting to the pro-Morsi session blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly who were also arrested during the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated to a suspended action plan. said plan was provided by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supported a controversial draft bill that would insure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all funds obtained illegally.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website sheds light on how the President's plans to support the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined to mention his sources under article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Office of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the provisions that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by doing so, the elimination of anonymous comments on social networks should be achieved. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as an" "" "organiser of information distribution." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to be held responsible for removing content and to compel them on request for the termination of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnowickniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blockade of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was closed because it became" "" "a source of information that works with groups to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world, in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance events that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and install web browsers that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services with regard to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation takes place until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Some 190 LGBTQ organizations signed a joint statement on the massacre in China on Monday.</seg>
