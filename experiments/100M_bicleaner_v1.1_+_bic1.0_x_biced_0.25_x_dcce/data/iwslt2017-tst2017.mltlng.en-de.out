this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he publicly announced that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has decided against Ris@@ en and called on him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to den@@ ounce whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists .
according to the First A@@ mend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous which they give .
so when the government ki@@ cked on at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
so , from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although argu@@ ing for years that it was essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the period of electronic surveillance , re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing and ris@@ king to make statements , it could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly procu@@ red his telephone inquiries ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel tips with the list of flights .
amid this information , they found evidence they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his appearances , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary more convic@@ ted than all U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put forward press work , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone .
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet when Ris@@ en had written down his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet &apos;s famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , like the here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to commit wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who fails to alarm the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall @-@ insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &apos; Panama Papers &apos; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; this week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the in Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has phil@@ atel@@ ic companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of child days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the documents revealed next .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent roman@@ cer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we tackle this ?
but the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , global wid@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka doll .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these scenes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the US .
presumably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has che@@ aters allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers participated in us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , implic@@ ated in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound as absurd as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a native optim@@ ist , I quite see that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU has gr@@ asp@@ ed in central registers at a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see these Panama @-@ Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a res@@ ale sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he enthusi@@ astically told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he even got worse the whole thing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock here ?
a wild alien sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ ak on toe @-@ tops to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought of me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered ?
to host people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is moving and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets were completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ aching , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of room whose doors are closing when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreigners to stay overnight .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in other people &apos;s homes .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you should focus on things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to let you unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who is Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he was chann@@ elled to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he told him where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can really hold out very well @-@ suited mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand in your cell phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest delivered their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
it is not surprising that we trust the people most of the time .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stir@@ s out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , for example &quot; Great art@@ works in your home ! I make a vacation with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to cast off these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
secondly , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
I worked with customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , of the 123 million spent nights , only a fraction of a problem had ever been a problem .
for men trust each other rightly .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not work .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a commercial trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply to call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are taking part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , it &apos;s possible to compare it with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place one visits , a group there would wait for it to fill a thoroughly and show a pub @-@ like neighborhood of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared part ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that the government belonged to ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . our platform alone will host 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries overnight in a foreign or self @-@ host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not invent the wheel again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospitality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was already there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think this is amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport &apos;s security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans believe that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I made a decision .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my he@@ address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence , against the pressure I felt as 17 year old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not just accepted passive faith in my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the channel and heard &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others changed from a citizen to a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to go to a new city and begin construction studies .
I remember how I was going -- when we were sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered to be Muslims , to free them and beat them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly be self @-@ explan@@ atory .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we start them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympic pioneers .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it may open a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque leads to view people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told me , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she had spoken brought her into silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fur@@ y , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their fur@@ y , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study reveals that if test persons present news in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to voice military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens .
handling Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it &apos;s not just about having to explain yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such a skilled young man out of my breasts ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon .
he shot eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , put off my shoes , and went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment , I am collap@@ sing .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who say that we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker working with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package creation penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting them , air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build independently re@@ charged structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our labs .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heck@@ starter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an aircraft that tries to strike two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most fli@@ ppers , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind @-@ bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flight devices , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simp@@ el , a lot happens in the inner life so that it can fly st@@ ably and can move everywhere in space .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to make it flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right when I see them is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the monster is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the om@@ nis@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise .
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a wide range of aesthetic expressions .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to invent new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wages in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy ; so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy converted .
this short moment they sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
after all , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing with us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Rot@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser beam to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to clarify some small , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the det@@ ecting of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes were extingu@@ ished through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ man of my death @-@ sick father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their by observations like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and compressed into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers in the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really alpine dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed by us when hitting the waves . the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o staff were declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott often claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice &apos;s talking about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision between two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No one who knows what he has to hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s take a closer look at what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns are cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o paved the way for an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them all .
the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are op@@ aque .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring out black holes as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ cking bones for our arch@@ eological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view of what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the sound and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to whom I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , eliminated my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ sau@@ cer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I am going to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; Yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir up your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I chal@@ k TV . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 Ep@@ iso@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so also on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to assemble my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just lying on the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreaming about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I put up troops as I painted on a canvas .
as a result , one sees a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a tot@@ em begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume that when I declare to them the hum@@ ming , I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is a joy for me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I started with television production , when I started to work and work , build , create , create , and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the tot@@ um is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the tot@@ um is music . the tot@@ als are light and air .
the tot@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a tot@@ em then you can &apos;t strive for size differently .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size no matter what price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just know that I &apos;m not a failure and I just know I love the tot@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you that I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the tot@@ um . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the tot@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single employee .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped .
the tot@@ um of the engine st@@ owed away .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ um did not come back .
my sum@@ o was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not exist , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no tot@@ em .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the tot@@ um and the tot@@ um was me .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , stupid author @-@ titanium &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , you work , you love what you do , being a teacher , being a master , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the hum@@ ming when you knew the tot@@ um , if you knew the tot@@ um , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this going to happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and my sw@@ am is smoking , and everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of total , I can &apos;t do anything except fitting out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax bars and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door approaches and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
not full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the tot@@ als , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the working sums , the title sum , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the tot@@ um is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the hum@@ ming is the flow that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ um ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for what God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any fault as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ wer@@ able to me as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of man would rather work than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we rush around in the garden , front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ med , absent , and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ y daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , it does not require any more .
everyone can bring 15 minutes to the tune , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes by piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m separating and winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ um came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ mons .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the tot@@ als of work are part of me , but just a part . I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I stir you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures .
certainly , they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is sw@@ inging and the cran@@ ial pressure rises .
to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen mass of the brain , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to make it thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw this under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may also know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly divided , and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ m@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we touched them at the removal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ graf@@ ting .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we were adding an injury and mat@@ ing exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been irrit@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ned in vitro , in culture .
here , of course , we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they did that very well .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now see when we irrit@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them with human beings .
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there might be no better excuse for Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my nasty friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for a true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group , succ@@ um@@ b to a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies will be m@@ owed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin Top Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash that belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , however , are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be spent on the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar that at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to blow out the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital make up the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand which feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , as in a continuous loop , feared the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors , in which they would not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful nature . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to pay special attention to all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political participation with the same m@@ oods in questions of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which in the end was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two began , as the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and escap@@ es it .
wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today in the government one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power from politics is diver@@ ted into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they end up star@@ ving .
the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ tops , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go particularly well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor are only reg@@ ain@@ ing a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is - very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ e @-@ auto@@ cracy that makes the movie &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that in the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used for human beings and their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples shortly .
in the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one employer to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , whom the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no vac@@ ant twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the total world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which she prefers privileged persons , and Marxist because it is buried in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esi@@ anische , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ anische .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we get into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands , and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing it does not mean that technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely cha@@ otic .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you are not t@@ wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I dare to say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to repro@@ ach China now , to do what the West had done in the 19th century , sm@@ elled immen@@ sely after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew it was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half @-@ year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continual denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have also chosen denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for 5 years they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone depends on someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of both Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ minute minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior manager at Amazon studios ,
der TV @-@ Produc@@ er von Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ refresh@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will receive .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as , &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he is more concerned about the medium coverage , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not enth@@ use .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such things , so Roy Price does not want to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , it &apos;s up to you , right ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve amounts to 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google does make mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis , they can predict failure of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a big sensation sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use lots of data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to make serious decisions , such as deciding on cancer therapy
over the years , I have identified some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , cr@@ ush this problem in its items so that you can analyze the items ; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a sure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for making better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decision making .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will try out with a technical demo later .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it pays off still to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
