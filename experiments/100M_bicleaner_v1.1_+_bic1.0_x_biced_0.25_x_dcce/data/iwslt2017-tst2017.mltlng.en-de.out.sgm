<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he publicly announced that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has decided against Risen and called on him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to denounce whistleblower and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous which they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government kicked on at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although arguing for years that it was essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and risking to make statements, it could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly procured his telephone inquiries,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel tips with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid this information, they found evidence they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his appearances, but instead the judiciary more convicted than all U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put forward press work, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist yet when Risen had written down his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitting system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the Internet's famous Aaron Swartz, and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, like the here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that threaten all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to commit wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who fails to alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall-insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the 'Panama Papers' revealed that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] this week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the in Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has philatelic companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of child days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the documents revealed next.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent romancer or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, global widness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, will be used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoshka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these scenes.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has cheaters allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers participated in us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician, implicated in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound as absurd as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist, I quite see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has grasped in central registers at a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama-Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness, this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a resale sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he even got worse the whole thing:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying, "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Well, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I gazed at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock here?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneak on toe-tops to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought of me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets were completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleaching, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publish pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of room whose doors are closing when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreigners to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in other people's homes.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you should focus on things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to let you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who is Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he was channelled to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he told him where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say:" "" "he can really hold out very well-suited mobile phones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand in your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest delivered their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is not surprising that we trust the people most of the time.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stirs out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, for example "Great artworks in your home! I make a vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to cast off these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked with customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million spent nights, only a fraction of a problem had ever been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay does not work.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is a commercial trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now simply to call it the" "" "rental industry" "", "the matter will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are taking part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, it's possible to compare it with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place one visits, a group there would wait for it to fill a thoroughly and show a pub-like neighborhood of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that the government belonged to,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. our platform alone will host 785,000 people in 191 countries overnight in a foreign or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invent the wheel again.</seg>
<seg id="245">"" "" "" "hospitality" "" "was already there." ""</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think this is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport's security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans believe that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I made a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my headdress.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you oppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, against the pressure I felt as 17 year old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted passive faith in my parents.</seg>

<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>

<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-aid and Olympic pioneers.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may open a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to view people of other faiths more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in Washington, DC recently told me, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even by their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>

<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she had spoken brought her into silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fury, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam reestablished the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their fury, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian regime, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals that if test persons present news in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they are more likely to voice military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Handling Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package creation penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting them, air devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently recharged structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"" "this is a so-called" "" "Heckstarter" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to strike two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than a helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most flippers, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind-bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flight devices, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simpel, a lot happens in the inner life so that it can fly stably and can move everywhere in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to make it flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I see them is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monster is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the omnister with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a wide range of aesthetic expressions.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to invent new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wages in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy; so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy converted.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they shone brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">After all, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing with us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Rotver from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser beam to search for gravitational-waves, which arise through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-Interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was started for a last test run to clarify some small, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detecting of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes were extinguished through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodman of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their by observations like Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and compressed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, teachers in the theory of relativity often lead to a really alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stoughed by us when hitting the waves. the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo staff were declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott often claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice's talking about Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision between two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same panty with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] No one who knows what he has to hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's take a closer look at what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns are circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paved the way for an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen in the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring out black holes as Ligo observes them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sucking bones for our archeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different point of view of what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "to whom I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-saucer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I am going to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "Yes" saga for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir up your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I chalk TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that simultaneously are in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 Episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so also on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to assemble my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just lying on the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I put up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, one sees a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A totem begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and humming sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I declare to them the humming, I'm talking about writing that writing is a joy for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I started with television production, when I started to work and work, build, create, create, and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The totum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totum is music. the totals are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a totem then you can't strive for size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">"" "this is called the" "" "sums." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "I just know that I'm not a failure and I just know I love the totals." ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you that I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things watch me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the humming, the totum, the totum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totum. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single employee.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totum of the engine stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sumo was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not exist, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no totem.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totum and the totum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "today, stupid author-titanium" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you do, you work, you love what you do, being a teacher, being a master, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the humming when you knew the totum, if you knew the totum, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "poses me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone any more" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm titanium and my swam is smoking, and everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, loneliness and lack of total, I can't do anything except fitting out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax bars and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing into "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door approaches and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">Not full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the working sums, the title sum, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the flow that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real totum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for what God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any fault as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not answerable to me as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what kind of man would rather work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmed, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teeny daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, it does not require any more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes to the tune, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm separating and winning. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to outdo myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totum came back in my spare time. the humming seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my summons.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totals of work are part of me, but just a part. I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing me that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the humming, the humming, the other, the right sum: the totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life in me is wide. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this humming, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think of things, I stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-brain traumas, the brain is swinging and the cranial pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen mass of the brain, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to make it thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may also know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly divided, and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublemtin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the embryonic stage, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we touched them at the removal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autografting.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we were adding an injury and mating exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyned in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here, of course, we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we irritated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his large imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there might be no better excuse for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my nasty friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group, succumb to a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies will be mowed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Top Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash that belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, however, are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and income that could be spent on the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion dollar that at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to blow out the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital make up the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand which feared the pessimism of investors, who, as in a continuous loop, feared the pessimism of the investors, in which they would not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful nature. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to pay special attention to all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the athenic democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political participation with the same moods in questions of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two began, as the economy gradually undergoes politics and escapes it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today in the government one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power from politics is diverted into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they end up starving.</seg>
<seg id="947">The power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-tops, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go particularly well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor are only regaining a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is - very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reshape the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hype-autocracy that makes the movie "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used for human beings and their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the" "" "Matrix" "" "-like dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one employer to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, whom the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no vacant twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the total world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which she prefers privileged persons, and Marxist because it is buried in the dustbin of history, and Keynesianische, globally keynesianische.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we get into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing it does not mean that technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers referred to as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will destabilise not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that is why I am a Libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and that is why I am also completely chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not twirl, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I dare to say this provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill -</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To reproach China now, to do what the West had done in the 19th century, smelled immensely after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew it was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half-year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "for us to say good-bye to complacency and the continual denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have also chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions going through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that for 5 years they had a catastrophic programme in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted," "" "This was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone depends on someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of both Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been at TED.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 medium-minute minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior manager at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">Der TV-Producer von Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelrefreshur and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows such as "Toddlers and Tiaras," -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He is more concerned about the medium coverage, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not enthuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such things, so Roy Price does not want to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, it's up to you, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve amounts to 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a risk and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work in such a way, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does make mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis, they can predict failure of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a big sensation sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly ceased to work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use lots of data unimaginable to make serious decisions, such as deciding on cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have identified some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, crush this problem in its items so that you can analyze the items; as a branch you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards," that wasn't in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as competing for TV ideas, then selecting" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a sure decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for making better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try out with a technical demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it pays off still to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
