Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where youngsters are to face today .
a mine chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich is sponsor@@ ing exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that had to be upset , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a carpet of pat@@ ch@@ work that can &apos;t be recognized as such .
in the great overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called judgments sheets , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were developed according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from Bavaria &apos;s first survey .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops came down with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbors today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and , like all others , can be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos;s website .
the comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was formed 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots still show no more farmers there - but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is sign@@ posted to the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the site of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s District of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; - in the area of today &apos;s District of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen .
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 there was the Munich @-@ based &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first there was room , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the asylum , which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t@@ renaissance chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days take place and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line will take place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Sup@@ porting Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , is ur@@ ging af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special care when travelling through the state .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to complain about discrimination , as well as the state law enforcement agencies that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline at the time of the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crimes .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will increase 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring their deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted in@@ tra @-@ immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing , according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Femin@@ ine fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties met at the Recht@@ gra@@ ben@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
only regional is added to the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este &apos;s table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably work on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area provides a lot of work , a lot must be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ isers , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leadership advancement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ forest@@ ation of the land could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants via the electric fence .
the area of disclosure therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by half over Le@@ aders , a quarter contributed by the community of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of gra@@ zing fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and country@@ women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care guidelines ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art convey@@ ance of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the prot@@ ru@@ ding surface must not be tractor @-@ operated ( inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Dec@@ athlon project , the motion of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals to dr@@ astically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of star@@ ship owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done so .
but it took its significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is quite correct , but as he articul@@ ated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the poor edding of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took a high political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives , who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , lonely , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge .
her torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite hatred , which is her only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship k@@ ader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ enko , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid @-@ distance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year has set five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which you should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates had voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to go to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics about Facebook : do not use a public office if you cannot tolerate the local voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the criticism , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed it at the start of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is designated as official and is un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous by employees who are paid with public tax dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments would be nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and non @-@ professional .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea either when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County fav@@ ored the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet .
the number of newspapers printed between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ dents put on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic convenience at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year left the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before losing Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieved its glory with this event , &quot; Rap@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home soil .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

reduce L@@ ung Cancer C@@ ote by Pas@@ sive Smo@@ king
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
to this end , scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) arrive in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are caused by passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Course Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there were more than 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in the time , &quot; said the head of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , location is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which continues to hin@@ der the construction work , is a major problem for the company &apos;s tro@@ op company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ am@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ment in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water out of the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous late to work dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was shot in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public lifting in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated sheets that were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans did their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ enced a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is the poor@@ est province in Indonesia where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an in Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua people have wood resources valued at $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military guards a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid close to $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy are threatening this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week occur@@ ren@@ ces happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased , since pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing , as Muslim econom@@ ists come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants began selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local Papua - the mom@@ my mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - cost their market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised during his campaign to tackle the ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their sound and later returned to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial shooting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle running and a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ak , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he told TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ v was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who was the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ki@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was &apos; filtered &apos; only the following day after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ elled to address the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME in Jak@@ arta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations of gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring a man unconscious to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started firing at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called for an account of the officers involved and to withdraw the police &apos;s mobile Brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free State Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty is boo@@ sting dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in inf@@ ra @-@ red is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold in the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua have rarely the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua in a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ am K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , dismissed the alleg@@ ations and said to journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals jour@@ ne@@ yed and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the session , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ cas@@ u@@ alties executed a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget the perpetr@@ ators of their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday at one of the highest motor@@ homes in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that , in only two years , swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise that is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the cries of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who called his name George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said that she was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage came from facing , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the Gren@@ fell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed away with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposition for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles only on two points of profit , is thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five set classics , which are often very long , but also very much appreciated , will remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many obj@@ ections , the proposal was already made to fill the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host &apos;s right next year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training vac@@ ancies etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that over 20 percent conscious or un@@ intentionally banned items were traffi@@ cked by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that the aircraft entered while accidentally driving a prohibited knife or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately sent by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent admitted to know@@ ingly wear items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately banned illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods brought by airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly most often .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which fluids you are allowed to take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the vast amount of objects confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre@@ positions for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ mined that some of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly trium@@ phant numbers on sales increases and even more titan@@ ic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure in announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition was just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that these are non @-@ binding reservations .
in the event of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 ) and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age that Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now approximately twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 it will - all models - will be 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines tested never before in practice with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , the non @-@ binding reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt r@@ ents to reduce emissions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the postpon@@ ement of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about a period that ran for States on October 1st to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly succeeded in blocking or dela@@ ying the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ pp regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator viol@@ ated his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply ampli@@ fied the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to adhere to deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
the New York State Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group wanted to uph@@ old legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health system and the conserv@@ ation@@ ists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ h &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ da complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ ficent Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle were first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ ges@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court to which the church , or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as emerges from the description of the Ober@@ salz@@ berg of Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the most beautiful sett@@ ling centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ Church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , continued to be the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ rou@@ ded at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were cut and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eve of 18@@ 34 a storm split the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the existing tower @-@ wer@@ der still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organisers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ arion &apos;s Chapel .
this is done by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
at the end of the seren@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers give out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope many supporters for the preservation of the historic St Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ tori@@ ums .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er rein@@ forces Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to have approval of wind turbines to be tested
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not have a legal requirement for construction and therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones shall prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette just a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a form failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted approval rate remains un@@ lawful and therefore also declined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appropriate letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle gives them the opportunity to re@@ consider the matter .
however , they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reasoning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four hundred metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed the lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households .
the NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
following police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car carried the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her passenger car as part of the accompanying passenger with her 53 year old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ eu and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
in doing so , the action aims not only on inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that refer to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
the Industrial Association and the City go to another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ appointed Sunday , discussions with all the entrepreneurs and hosts to move them into active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end , all would have to contribute to li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread in part , the king had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time .
apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her buying behaviour own direct environment .
two dead and several injured after an explosion in U.S. school
during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further human beings have been injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people have been killed and nine more have been injured , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade on Wednesday ( local time ) an injured person was in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
one first of all was found dead later .
the dead were the employees of the school .
as a result , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp bet after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary walls &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp challenged En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president ap@@ plau@@ ded him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists manage rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators at the Mon@@ roe County , Georgia , and rum@@ oured to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block their way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stick suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates moved in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged away from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience cast a very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists went back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really unbelievable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil prot@@ ector .
for him , the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medical doctor lays a blanket over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com did a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby that she wore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more succ@@ inct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual mo@@ ore of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - crowded into a space and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role never gets easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ soccer Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , scre@@ aming and pushing him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , win@@ ded away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; As@@ cona said .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ uring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of comra@@ des@@ hip replaces the discomfort .
everybody is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ rup@@ tly and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands above the body of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning praise to &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced a burst of humidity all nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks performs her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ching rope away and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ mus hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair from Atlanta talks about the im@@ position with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the n@@ ailing still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks keeps on his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hind@@ ran@@ ce is in a way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner movement to Bayreuth &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f is staging a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine sm@@ el@@ ters pose as rock@@ ers , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which runs through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhein@@ kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - are wonderfully harmon@@ ised as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
they perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , tu@@ g a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ia and give the Kra@@ kon@@ o @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously fi@@ esen Hagen , which envel@@ ops the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause .
stor@@ my Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are humble and form@@ ly bowed their hands to Merkel &apos;s r@@ allies .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat and casual wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about himself , there was a big jubil@@ ation five years later , in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it also has grown an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive summary .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked on the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken a S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering course , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it like that ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably doing a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you do your FS@@ J .
you can make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all the fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people in front of them , each having a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been brought out of the family - one must always respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is just like that .
Pear@@ son abbrevi@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce additional 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company .
the reduction of jobs , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the most part by the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , an explanation of NATO agreed .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h neighborhood .
the bombing is the last violence done by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an attitude of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; carried out impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the near B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ aker killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pressed the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 countries su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to co @-@ operate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to specify where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s Municip@@ ality , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental premi@@ ums imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tru@@ mp , is supposed to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the demo@@ crats and nature groups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back @-@ backs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and increasing respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ at wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ e @-@ Win@@ ds decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the sales contract for the still missing part of the land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a long time until the area belonging to the church community has been in municipal ownership , there is no need for a planning fee for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor .
for this , there is a discussion regarding a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat is offered to meet the congregation .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council ho@@ vers to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , is influenced by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a common space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposal looks for the investor to signal that in this regard there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the rise height and makes the construction economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean this addition .
when it helps : he passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it is not as easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings with which you won &apos;t get the right way forward , but now you lean towards the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any existing or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but get a real counter @-@ value , which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to pro@@ mul@@ gate the proposed resolution finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision this way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is s@@ lung on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and seriously injured .
as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year long Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from Schwar@@ zer to Hil@@ den on the way from Schwar@@ zer to Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving licence in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder came onto the road , he obviously didn &apos;t take care of the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered grave injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ling car .
FC Bayern München has to ren@@ ounce on the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals miss the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football record champion Bayern München gets bigger and bigger at Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in the Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the coins are missing : Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory pr@@ elu@@ de of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti , who was expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of ast@@ er@@ isk walking to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to meet the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accessible installations at five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in question , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the panels should be completed on the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ base the viewers will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star has more light than another , although it lies much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the Harz National Park , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ gal@@ axy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet route - at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet travels with its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Gli@@ ding ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to at the end of the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun shines exactly 75 meters away at least 70 centimet@@ ers .
the whole distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun up to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed stern but would take another half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to present the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ but@@ tered World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion who went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Sus@@ pension champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko will defend his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; of magnitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for the Bron@@ x &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko began to agree .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound ster@@ ling this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight against the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he liked Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held out with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think that the triple battle champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to tire plat@@ zer
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a probably lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 a.m. just before the connection point of the market .
the car r@@ ushed to the right into the gu@@ ise , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then traffic on the left stri@@ pe could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to kick off the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ises the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , though not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ cycle is also to be optimised further .
and the For@@ tun@@ as do not want to catch a gate any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain experience , than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident in his case , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ dimensional chain at intermediate positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford so many playing errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is also riding to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we get four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know anything about it .
&quot; I only judged the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Eng@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled early because of a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that Au@@ e &apos;s players might even be a bit fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una versus a promotion favor@@ ites in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rheinland will be treated as favour@@ ites on Sunday to the meeting in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to get under the top six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no squ@@ ad in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s boss @-@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ evaluation tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medical Association ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were inferior .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency rated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been ongoing in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that &quot; the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she realized that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans in order to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the road construction department and transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete v@@ aul@@ ted concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , respectively , 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is an edge fastening , which is also used as an operating way .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is supposed to run .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
furthermore , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished out .
for the bridges between the building yard and the ec@@ lec@@ tor in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by one lane by one lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully blocked for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach site entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge group@@ ings amount to 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest against German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the chal@@ k of volcan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein Town Hall R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and familiar names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the African people , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that is offering itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ pes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic ice , he took care of such an event and received the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the Ro@@ un@@ del , Hom@@ er is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the audi@@ torium there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no particular occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; a meeting with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available in the Has@@ la@@ cher convent concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the convent church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and win solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra is Pet@@ kov &apos;s solo trumpet player at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ ziger N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has especially written for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt a bitter deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with everything I took . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten claimed that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered in school time when she prefers to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to get in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I &apos;ll tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal burner from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working on it to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the few legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sports .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who won gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to re@@ porters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tragedy for Mali St@@ oned Sol@@ di@@ ers
during a funeral service in the northern Hes@@ sian town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ clari@@ fied crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two top pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ ns of their Speci@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Republic of Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and taken on Thursday by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day , only the members of the church took leave of the church .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning @-@ branches laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and carved in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff tig@@ gered the flight operation of the combat helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers were , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , there would have been no one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Le@@ yen &apos;s minister : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Dom@@ kirche .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already produced a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also retired the title &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal court .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ cked , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk grass instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of soci@@ etal intellectual , I couldn &apos;t hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a potential majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister , Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the parliament postpon@@ ed its resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from their state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to record them .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled for January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag is resol@@ utely aware of its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Minister @-@ President withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be examined legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be able to discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something wei@@ rd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described herself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pendant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of black @-@ green . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous dep@@ uties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we naturally assume that she res@@ ig@@ ns her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received over the Green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have made a conscious decision not to take any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ ests from Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty trick and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dut@@ sch@@ sens CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ manager Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to put El@@ ke T@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the v@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the concerned eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible .
Al@@ di is now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ continued immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ free and harmless to health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the residual value of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
rather , they must account for economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the seri@@ ousness .
is there only one thing missing on the staff or in the case of conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 per cent .
this is precisely why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ ready food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , retailers and consumers are caught in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated forth@@ with .
it is necessary to work on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be swiftly and un@@ resolved .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded editions of the European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules established in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose in order for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the powerful ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they must be subject to legitimate revenue streams , which allow them to break even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the crew and build a global brand - a harder issue .
in the current three @-@ year lease period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini fell into dis@@ grace from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the N@@ ey@@ mar buy @-@ out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the release sum for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies connected to the owners of a club .
while a catar@@ act could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be due to payments from the organisation committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulation authorities could be easy to find .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to respecting the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announ@@ cer on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with revenues of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and it has completely changed the entire landscape of football during the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because there are different ways or different interests can have when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier of chocolate
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board @-@ chocolate has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation has come to an end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request from the news agency s@@ da , confirmed the report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very pleased with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate bars distribute to 14 grams a year the flight atten@@ dant before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants come up with the new announcement .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty on the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate bars distribute Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss Life concluded a Mig@@ ros subsidiary agreement , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has produced chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
two and a half years ago , Swiss made the opportunity to place the logo at the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is also part of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the An@@ de@@ an David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter made the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humor@@ ous ( it contained an original story for a talking vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking on the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play cool kids who grow up - they still managed to regain the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more on the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point , a character emerges through an Apple Power@@ book , some in @-@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ et type of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ins@@ anity that might acc@@ use this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang of film premi@@ eres of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ ding another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lica , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to watch ( the police are spending the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures decent playing &quot; Find out the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
in six long episodes , the comedy runs away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was re@@ patri@@ ated to a lesser extent , could deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re better , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in hitting the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts have been issued against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the C@@ ID Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
most of all Italian nation@@ als with reference to the Italian ma@@ fia were mainly concerned with investigations .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s bank account .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s registry in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly grave mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s centr@@ alised register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could result in asylum procedures and deportation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly grave mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , data quality has not been good in sharing so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in isolated cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false noti@@ ons led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is to say in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government obviously began sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have been there .
this is caused by an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU State to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to it as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ pa@@ k , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the un@@ lawful reception conditions and endanger@@ ment of child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who received the award on Friday .
to all of them Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his meanwhile 100 donations shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community hon@@ ors multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; underlined Archbishop Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the roundabout head of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
so three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn cre@@ ators reported the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK district team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , a few years ago , the change to the Theat@@ erhaus had led to a higher number of participants .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 donated blood donations .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ j@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter released ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthening pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted for 6 @-@ 2 % to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month reluct@@ ant to increase as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in their quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ aled that interest rate increases would be necessary in the coming years to re@@ strain the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the loan costs would probably have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut stimulus package , issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the finance plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to be bur@@ dened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast indicated in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell on this news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate rise and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and slight rise in salary , as the tightening is even worse before it gets better .
it added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent income from income , &quot; but it added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forec@@ asting will be &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is compensated for part of lower consumption spending .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pl@@ under .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers asking for 0.5 % increase in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said it was expected and will put it on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the excess in proportion to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of recent swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is especially good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are completed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS from September onwards .
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service on a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice last year after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alleg@@ ation that local authorities should finance it .
the ch@@ es@@ suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to having intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so even two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who question the treatment belong to gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be reviewed by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is sold £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ haul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges facing humankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , when focused on vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ ers with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square feet were completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne D@@ ow@@ age and a mezzanine add to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to let it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars made by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter @-@ important , so that when you push the door , you slide very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form , real estate agents will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor surface while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electric outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute about one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business capacity should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the Gold Coast apartments and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul amounting to $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - as Col@@ in , as Paul affir@@ ms , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but ref@@ utes Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ lade of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lux@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to convey their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , where Col@@ in claims that $ 10 million and Luke 26 million were paid when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire became the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media received Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by text message to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports , hoping to hold the head on an even higher rate .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the President &apos;s hands .
Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnos@@ es makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring their media diet .
President Tru@@ mps &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was upset about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mps Twitter habits under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mps &apos;s Twitter habit ever was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know yet - that Tru@@ mps twe@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his employees manage to keep it away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently avoided it that Tru@@ mp raises controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , repeatedly try to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that perhaps promotes their views of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of the advis@@ ors to provide the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from .
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody intentionally bl@@ amed the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ erg@@ us@@ .com , the website of Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced up false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began questioning people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House general secretary Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe will send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer .
as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience has shown that many fle@@ ets hide at vacation destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for sought criminals out of 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ e.V which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests could be arrested until now , at least 11 on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers bar@@ gain over a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some determined travellers on the war foot , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the commune in order to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans in a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire row . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without having been deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged from the Council to prevent their invasion .
the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous user said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by means of shame , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised repository on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former Ambiente company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenues from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in light of rising numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been a construction waste container in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer finds expression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer says .
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special En@@ ter sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special negoti@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded the work in recent weeks and wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigation .
the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there were already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , deliberately interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential elections .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mps Ele@@ ction Team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller examined more and more about the private and business environment under the microscope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special negoti@@ ator Tru@@ mp has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential off@@ ences and to decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jury is therefore also called the act of indictment .
most of the time , they are turned on if they are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Board can also be powered by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite people to take consultations under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp &apos;s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were part of the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if needed , he should act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp .
amid the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he won &apos;t be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to believe that something has changed , it was explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this alleg@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been wor@@ ded , he tried to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
in June Com@@ ey testified before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media the White House collected material against the special agent and his collabor@@ ators .
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later res@@ igned president , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over 1 tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
the extent to which climate change played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
however , for around 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice @-@ stu@@ ds in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can dis@@ integrate , if a piece is broken down at a key location .
the melting of ice @-@ ice and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting .
however , the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only slightly , writes the UK research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we don &apos;t know any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf should grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not trace the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , so many of the Antar@@ ctic ice cre@@ ams have fallen in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches in the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and is therefore one of the quick@@ est regions in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs in administration have entered the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
however , the circle is still lacking in personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , showing concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , who are leaving the service due to illness or age due to illness or age .
high time to act , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party .
he long ago cared for a f@@ oul surprise in the circle of the district , when he publicly challenged the human resource covering and start@@ led the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a house tari@@ ff , &quot; says peoples .
thus the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for public service charges .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money are only available when switching to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO Mig@@ rant @-@ Res@@ cue Bo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that campaign rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs fail to sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively worked with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation for only one year , refused to express itself in the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are directly delivered to them by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ shad@@ owing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North pf@@ alz to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael &apos;s chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
viewing points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ ages market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the lookout point came to the lookout , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ roads brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga ro@@ ars for E @-@ sport
will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
this has also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga associations , which are becoming increasingly involved in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an E @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire very new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Federation FIFA organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the societies tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA will compete at competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other .
and with the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ last has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for Professor at the German Spor@@ ts@@ college in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which are also found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also to train their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ rank player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientists highlight the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally travelling , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study conducted by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Hochschule ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the rapid growth of e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , a total of 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales will be at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , that is little .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far away from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; wrote the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants .
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport Wag@@ on Uni@@ que .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ last .
in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga clubs are now under obligation to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to decay in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is not enough today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time focusing on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way to stick to the fact that everything remains as it always was when it comes to football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Conrad Roy displac@@ ing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free right up to his calling .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had been suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward directional eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness has a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day in which I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my pain we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep in with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , do yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted of murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new mini bar of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ mir was allowed to run as captain on the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern p@@ olls a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not damaging there .
there was something different on his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ mir immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he put his arm in his arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the fed @-@ cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stand could have gone better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the sign of the coach as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f received from young players , de@@ but@@ ant and straight from the holiday , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those whom you would like to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to compete with L@@ ame &apos;s heritage can only use a little bit of extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was ti@@ ck@@ ling as a mini bar on the field .
to the right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ i seemed to be the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ assembled tro@@ op .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches on the de@@ vil@@ s come out of the services of the Asia trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot not to be neg@@ atively noticed .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a couple of times successfully in the game build @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we have hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw afterwards the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir passed away after a few cris@@ p statements on his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates O@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous soccer player has registered just before the game via Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wanted all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ ary is a quasi @-@ Klu@@ b@@ Colum@@ bine of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and with our La@@ dies .
the twe@@ ets of the Austrian football team of the year and champi@@ ons League winners should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings speed
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minist@@ erial minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge gras@@ ps the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top in the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building law is supposed to stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ ways Plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ er Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , aims at the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that have been bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , commen@@ cing the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts of Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates go independently within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road building is quick to provide facts , at the same time out of the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who want to hire Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business , up to now only 29 jobs are occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads by 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country to rec@@ tify the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , ex @-@ Minister for Economic Affairs , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving constraints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he referred to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust gases ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of expos@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also take part , on tomorrow &apos;s Saturday a raft is driving through Munich , which has a special message .
if it gets to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach Bridge .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large volume of infections .
it shows a waste mountain .
the start of a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a deser@@ ving bo@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and actions to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ens and the Lau@@ ghter against the Sor@@ rows
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the bun@@ ni@@ es of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an traces and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
time and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .
with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his funny figures continue to spread widely worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV show with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of most popular animals in his drawings - who has a thousand foot@@ ers as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come onto the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are going to say , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV show , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ ding .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence at risk of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
because of the conditions of dro@@ ught , the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the insect @-@ transferring insects , which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the fall .
this has an effect on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts attention not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and de@@ cel@@ er@@ ation of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ 10th anniversary this year .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
in these days , Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a rural sc@@ aff@@ old are to be experienced in the city centre .
the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce collabor@@ ators usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the Sin@@ alo@@ a State due to organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the corp@@ ses accumulate in the whole country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 , there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great picture of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with spectac@@ les or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General was built in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and although the terrain is now more av@@ enger .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are di@@ str@@ ust to all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and was shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated by &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey mouse ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after sei@@ zing another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ I award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that appears to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird who could cur@@ sing like a do@@ ck@@ yard , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret startup and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong@@ ly , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then things have happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the members of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before have been announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were mand@@ ated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers , who called the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters went into the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenses , which was concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled all the political levels almost throughout the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informative source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body style . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers which protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few characters and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in the whole country , journalists have become more ph@@ one@@ tic by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez goes away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying and killing journalists , because they said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket .
the media guar@@ dian group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana did by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their own countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade is scar@@ ed him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when suddenly all their phones began to hum@@ ming .
a number of gun@@ men with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the ker@@ bs , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on their mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens were close by - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible all over Sin@@ alo@@ a , the members of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r exempl@@ ars in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dose din@@ osau@@ rs living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researcher , who describes it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has ast@@ o@@ unded his incredibly well preserved condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blin@@ dly smile with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r exempl@@ ars - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to better interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the stunning preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and arm@@ ors about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution favor the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ sh@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age must have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his preserved bow@@ el content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably farther inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dose din@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only lay a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the King of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ght@@ less monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was sw@@ ung through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house branches cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes .
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole &apos; .
thunder@@ storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injuries , kilometres @-@ long St@@ out and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon .
according to the first figures of the police , around 17@@ .00 hrs between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles were killed during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably trucks .
the exact number of the injured had no indications at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in Munich &apos;s driving direction , a ten @-@ kilometre long back was formed .
as an A@@ Z Re@@ porter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive handi@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the features of the vehicle electri@@ cians , who now have to expect sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ eted .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available for many other long distances in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the validation of the ticket without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to purchase the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of booking the ticket .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the test customers , a button will appear for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is in place at the ticket inspec@@ tor , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train crew will simply check in themselves in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the marketing board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who go by rail often know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest occasions .
because of@@ ten@@ times you do not have all the documents you need to vali@@ date online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , resulting in bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time taking care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just for the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same track are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed up Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly retri@@ eved on her Tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ete the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was out@@ stretched on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to go back to T@@ we@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le and sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand responses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves .
even if I have the chance to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Department , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question asked Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often white in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt det@@ ain@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement is not a Messiah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her and married her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the Black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news eras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is not cold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while they say a bit to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ets ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , as well as the rest of the business , the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction works will be concluded .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the house@@ wives are always happy again .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also happening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; above all the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing col@@ li@@ des in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the shopping palette in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the commodity offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above all inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , as the mi@@ ds there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes .
or does the ghost bit @-@ gallery already manage to drive all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty doesn &apos;t need anyone .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no more room thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ notic@@ e@@ ably the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ t@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being secretly licensed to publish diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her professional competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and dissi@@ dent dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in office .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about her identity as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde per@@ ig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t attend this time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became an un@@ equal public , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ otti would turn judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp runs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to develop new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the stub@@ born circuits he actually should fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic disper@@ sion whose basis is sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic book mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges with a hands @-@ free tel@@ eph@@ on in his hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ask your question , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a country@@ wide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are considered susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries .
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and Det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
it has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an email explanation that he had now been judged and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal procedure examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ aga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause any concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren at the state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intended to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia during the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di no longer sells eggs anymore

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to perform surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C suite leaders and direct to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , based on the innovative Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ gence has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ gence companies can send bes@@ po@@ ke &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ gence has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the Con@@ ver@@ gence company uses Con@@ ver@@ gence , problems that have previously been hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical off@@ ences caused by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ gence offer your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
G@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and raised his total financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
high wages and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are well worth , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain ren@@ ders if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes do not come fast enough , or not at all , this can result in disappointment and dem@@ oti@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have been too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after obtaining feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11 pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are chat@@ ting on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot surfaces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return after the three @-@ hour practice to their final examinations before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7.@@ 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 before the start of the formal preparations for their ki@@ ck@@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change in rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ e@@ ously continued , they &apos;re great people .
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices once the camp is over , which is not an easy task in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been dis@@ car@@ ded with foot@@ balls that have been clearing a net behind a gate .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to third parties with false reports and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fact inspec@@ tors , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate the asser@@ tion of hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts checking was started .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linked articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to l@@ essen false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ ies and 1980 @-@ ies .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the F@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says calm@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swi@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greetings a bit &quot; ) all this seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &apos; new &apos; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape nur@@ ses , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the era of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go their way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , whom the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the ornam@@ ent Arthur Dar@@ rell is depicted in the 18th century , who produced his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , making money again and again and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men broke their school crises by mar@@ rying about rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ mines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences
he had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle en@@ folds in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef last Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cre@@ ators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was up@@ stream yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honnef citizen know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in the competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the head of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been acting in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in Military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ ff ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the growth of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan made a decree by decree to fire further 7@@ 3@@ 95 servic@@ emen , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ t their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly non @-@ appointed officer , seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not leave Nato air@@ tight .
in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens will be issued from other countries green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the present system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ ate route for road transport
over the past few months it has always been cont@@ ested about the future of the race shuttle - now it should go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the ailing track on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the race shuttle , construction work on the track should begin this year according to data from the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this connection , especially for tourism , &quot; said the secretary of state Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the track were reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ laps 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this meant that the shuttle @-@ shuttle was to be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway link popular with tourists between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are a big issue at the moment .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( F@@ FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively .
modern sl@@ ings have developed into robots using a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed personalities like Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female attributes , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most .
true to its website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ ises to have attacked women sexually .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the daughter &apos;s eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no background or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fantasy of total subj@@ ection .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the words of 2017 : ma@@ ids
do you like a big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , in the USA , there were papers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp close relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to let our filter bli@@ sters bur@@ sting .
less noticed is the power of the Tru@@ mps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone whom it knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but in another context it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp but the destructive effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the sc@@ ary possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards .
today I find myself surrounded by an active No@@ stal@@ gie for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Habitat &apos;s Car@@ us@@ el , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are sc@@ ary and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music im@@ parts this in a curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not very happy about the day when I discovered that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - it is a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , as here two two @-@ year old , an 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have reviewed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to the hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
because of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first dead prison sentence after a criminal appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blum@@ berger Schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was released by the four @-@ t@@ oll@@ ers from F@@ arch@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during their holidays and in secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
school Manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte on Tuesday evening welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grew up in the hen @-@ farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the hen &apos;s farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a hen @-@ guil@@ d a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread his wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studio .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders were carrying the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each quad@@ rant to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps to classes of instruction , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the coastal time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
she did not leave her students very reluct@@ antly after two years of teaching , for it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ater .
finally , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , announced .
on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and put everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inspections are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission of emissions from the emissions cap of Euro 5 and partly to Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have the che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet announced an exact date .
Daimler announced to write to any affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its scope .
how long should the conver@@ sions be drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the depen@@ dency on the involvement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the topic environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
most likely , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
now threat@@ ens a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older dies@@ els so far .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J is awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ our@@ ists .
prizes will be awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award @-@ winning Le@@ ar award winner , announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that it will be part of the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp in order to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach City Buil@@ der , goes to retirement in the coming year .
the position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
since 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he talks about in the press conference .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far no application will fill the requirements profile .
the town is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , considering the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Has@@ lach works as a sub@@ urban civil authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must show corresponding qualifications .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if this could no longer be fulfilled , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but citizen proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years of office , several important projects have gathered to look back at the field of pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ hof parking space have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still an issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike at around 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a mayor of large clear@@ ances .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and garden you can react quite flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town is listed as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensemble &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the out@@ going city building master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mayor of the city already bears a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event of care and coordination , he can count on long@@ time employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information from the city of Has@@ lach , you should have completed a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with a subject of architecture and have a good knowledge of the areas of construction and construction planning right .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ lies high and civil engineering , construction management , gr@@ under@@ ing facilities , management of the urban properties , municipal depot with building yard and municipal garden , as well as underground building law authority including monuments protection .
bicycle on cables thrown : south railway line locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle away from the railroad tracks in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night .
near the crime scene witnessed a cru@@ sty Roll@@ er- and a bicycle @-@ driver witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a realm of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could have put themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delay of delay and the costs for the rail transport service , sponsors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been remedi@@ ed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern run@@ way could be led without disabilities .
almost ten people had fallen off on Friday morning , two of them watched the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not drop out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
however , a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is prone to inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to find a type of tolerance supporting immune cell in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food the more they had these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , but had not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial flavors had to do with mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ biological and they did not develop these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers gave L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
as the active ingredient was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
when Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his Start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington &apos;s US state , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that &apos;s several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new dip for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party head , but no head@@ wind from the League - was thus the most important wish of the voters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed radically .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with a growing horror .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ winds in the approach .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after the other .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising faction meeting of a Green MP has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Prime Minister El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Bureau of Business and Ele@@ ction Director of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD candidate si@@ ghs when the new ob@@ scene message reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after crossing the green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ ests .
it is the preliminary highlight of a series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades relaxed .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into pi@@ geons , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously re@@ bu@@ ked in the weeks after .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next low blow .
mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the crisis communication after that , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z struggles for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
giant survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is no fault at the party internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians of the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ owns puts her own career choices over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the Party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected to Parliament by the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Lower Saxony State Parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins about an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters four years ago were clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; says op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents a future CD@@ U member the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local center III
those who want to moderni@@ ze their homes in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what was happening so far .
since 1991 there are rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for sh@@ ind@@ lers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful projects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the president of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe provided the information that there will be a rehabilitation zone III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country , the rest of the congregation sensi@@ tivities .
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ind@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area to san@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the territorial borders may also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foot@@ bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be established as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding runs until 30 April 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , as far as possible , the description of the sentence is to take place , so that the san@@ itations can be started in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each Commune had to carry out the said preventive examinations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide when to rehabil@@ itate the town @-@ related ab@@ norm@@ alities and to decide on what extent .
for the respective property there is also a rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ zation in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
he emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the co @-@ operation of the participants .
for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , division and habit@@ ants of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a re@@ development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the palaces of houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to launch a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military information left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president is onboard , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and White House officials , made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was issued alongside a boat from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire station and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , the Assistant Military Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was finally required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the event .
&quot; a question we asked was if it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated as the official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was under way in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation in February when the presidential airplane was flying against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to offset the American president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 US dollars per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the costs for tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for ref@@ using rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered the tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ okes with the media about his own fleet of company products .

TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
runner @-@ up of the second Tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the Table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the top riders of the second tennis league made the sense of the reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , at any rate , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high North are above all ensured for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also heavily in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
while at the moment the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella is not part of the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec will be the first in this season .
yesterday , the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ la@@ nik @-@ Castillo won the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ shoul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ us@@ z could once again push into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee starts at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay to the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
not surprisingly , Donald Tru@@ mp did not work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress addressed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan to punish European companies that will help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then investors of the Austrian O@@ MV are concerned , which , together with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian eastern sou@@ ther@@ ship Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions for life by means of an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could defle@@ ct and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer disclosed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the newest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Am@@ mann ) orders the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .

other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the town exhibits 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the Youth Aid department , is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking remains apart from the house : a cat@@ erer loses this task and delivers freshly squee@@ zed ch@@ illed .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime not only children , who are cared for 45 hours of the week , eat lunch at the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff from 1st September have kitchen service : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , rin@@ se off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ een units - decide on the range of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the capitalists to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has found itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economical one , it means from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at about 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , senior vice @-@ president of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will join the council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international fighting action to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will still reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to information from the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , stopped at 2.@@ 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in Man@@ agers of Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces Hob@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits as well as other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties &apos;s owner , Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s subsidiary , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not advanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t get any clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the Glasgow largest area , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , from the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production down@@ turn , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we estimate continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our mot@@ o@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changed at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned Barcelona three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La League site may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning home to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ana incident that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players signing , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Club expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Review reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen leaves for discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their false assessment of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are measured when reporting on violence among the dome @-@ cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ep@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ ep@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a bon@@ ed Fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been a completely normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of the abuse pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ or@@ ative book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report that the Ulrich Weber appointed by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg has presented with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 67 dom@@ ain@@ ts sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of a high degree of emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , may even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on the protection of property at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many pupils stand out for their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ er@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became pal@@ p@@ able in the oil , when a cathedral @-@ record brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
it is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence in the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
at best , one can repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have not taken the first indications very seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ ot@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s vast majority puts an excellent record , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always been moved from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to burst out@@ breaks .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just squee@@ ze with chairs and put the key ring on the ground , but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ards and too che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself had promised himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his ret@@ ali@@ ation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , who was born in 1968 .
I have also experienced it in a secular school , a high school .
compared to what it actually is in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is true to Bag@@ at@@ ella .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no translations available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a question of whether it is not his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many who never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still busy di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is that the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , there was much talk about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger published in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the off@@ erer &apos;s representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then it would certainly not be a chorus master who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
what is the rate of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an inqu@@ iring disciple put it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was imp@@ uted or clear or even more open than in front of their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he cannot be accused of having prevented him from being hin@@ dered or brought to the ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is clearly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report covers events from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys were regularly har@@ assed and portrayed by sa@@ di@@ st teachers , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he didn &apos;t get the boys on their faces until they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was how most of the witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ cal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
only Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently sh@@ ears his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome of the dome , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the capital punishment would continue to be practiced at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows well .
for him it was difficult to assess where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was not until 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; fall @-@ sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past with today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is right there .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what was bre@@ ached at the pre @-@ school on resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the then usual practice .
this is all very terrible and I am happy that it will finally work .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take refuge , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is to say , ear cow@@ ards and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the issue of testing also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone you do not make a great singer and before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , underground , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ ti@@ ly good people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could not do anything .
I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him until now , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
today , most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father @-@ like teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and whom they almost worship .
and please , once again quite clearly : all you have been accused of are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which was just published reli@@ eves him .
now the attraction would be to make a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
