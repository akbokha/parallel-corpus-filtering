<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where youngsters are to face today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich is sponsoring exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that had to be upset, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a carpet of patchwork that can't be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map, detailed maps, so-called judgments sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bayerisches Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originates from Bavaria's first survey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops came down with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the neighbors today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original document for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was formed 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flutes from the so-called "urine" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots still show no more farmers there - but small farmers in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is signposted to the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's District of Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" - in the area of today's District of Au-Haidhausen.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 there was the Munich-based" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first there was room, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianum meet on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the asylum, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked in 1856 as" "" "main place" "", "the Kaufinger street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a cryptrenaissance chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days take place and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Supporting Farms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, is urging afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special care when travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to complain about discrimination, as well as the state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten up or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline at the time of the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crimes.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will increase 75 percent more often than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring their deposit money or let their relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted intra-immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling, according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Feminine fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, the "Black Forest milk" is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regional is added to the Feriengaeste's table.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the" "" "BLHV-Chairman of Fischbach" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "essential." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably work on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, a lot must be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he does not conduct bio-operations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leadership advancement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">With a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by half over Leaders, a quarter contributed by the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of grazing fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and countrywomen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care guidelines (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-of-the-art conveyance of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the protruding surface must not be tractor-operated (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fisherman's Decathlon project, the motion of eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of starship owners and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is quite correct, but as he articulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, and the poor edding of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the ties between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, lonely, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite hatred, which is her only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish contingent in the world championship kader will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butenko, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"" "the" "" "mid-distance" "" "Muir leads on this path and last year has set five British and two European records." ""</seg>

<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which you should watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates had voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to go to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this do-it-yourselfers and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics about Facebook: do not use a public office if you cannot tolerate the local voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued it at the start of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook" "", "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is designated as official and is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous by employees who are paid with public tax dollars.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments would be nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and non-professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea either when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff referred to as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items and to arrest or arrest demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County favored the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers printed between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents put on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, dismissed the allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and there are free media, making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations."</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilda complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneficent Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle were first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urgesbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court to which the church, or the right of patronage belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As emerges from the description of the Obersalzberg of Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the most beautiful settling centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-Church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, continued to be the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shrouded at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were cut and the bell-parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eve of 1834 a storm split the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the existing tower-werder still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor to Dieter Dockhorn, the successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Kreis Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="720">The reduction of jobs, which General Director John Fallon announced for the most part by the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>

<seg id="758">The establishment of a common space would be, as reported Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposal looks for the investor to signal that in this regard there is no billet between the legs, the statement that both semitrailers - what is leaning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pulpit roof - which reduces the rise height and makes the construction economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer does not mean this addition.</seg>

<seg id="804">In question, St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the panels should be completed on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the train should be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starbase the viewers will learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association declared.</seg>
<seg id="810">In addition, they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star has more light than another, although it lies much further away.</seg>
<seg id="811">Also, in which constellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>

<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the pluto at the end of the dwarf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun shines exactly 75 meters away at least 70 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="819">The whole distance of the planet's path is about four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="820">While the light from sun up to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.</seg>

<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases suggesting that "the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>

<seg id="896">The method of the medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven ton heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of the road construction department and transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete vaulted concrete covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges run across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, respectively, 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating way.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of intuition has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Furthermore, fish and crustaceans had to be fished out.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the eclector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by one lane by one lane.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded editions of the European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules established in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG eventually has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose in order for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the powerful ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be subject to legitimate revenue streams, which allow them to break even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts, effectively cheat and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the crew and build a global brand - a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the current three-year lease period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini fell into disgrace from the Presidency of 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the release sum for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataract could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be due to payments from the organisation committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulation authorities could be easy to find.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to respecting the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, announcer on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with revenues of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bankers with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square feet were completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne Dowage and a mezzanine add to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to let it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars made by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counter-important, so that when you push the door, you slide very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the floor - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a vestigial form, real estate agents will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electric outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute about one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business capacity should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast apartments and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin is described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul amounting to $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - as Colin, as Paul affirms, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but refutes Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy-bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeanslade of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began West co when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LuxTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to convey their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to come to court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports, hoping to hold the head on an even higher rate.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the President's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnoses makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring their media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places to convince," "" "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habits under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know yet - that Trumps tweets would have included even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees manage to keep it away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided it that Trump raises controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, repeatedly try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that perhaps promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisors to provide the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody intentionally blamed the president a printed copy of an article from Gotergus.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced up false accusations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began questioning people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House general secretary Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special negotiator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee recorded the work in recent weeks and wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "referring to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, deliberately interfering with the 2016 presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trumps Election Team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"" "" "" "in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign." ""</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller examined more and more about the private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special negotiator Trump has personally moved into the center and investigate whether the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential offences and to decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also called the act of indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on if they are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Board can also be powered by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite people to take consultations under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former head chef Paul Manafort, were part of the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if needed, he should act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia's affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he won't be determined against the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was explained in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this allegation, accusations against Trump have been worded, he tried to obstruct the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June Comey testified before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media the White House collected material against the special agent and his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether Trump Mueller wants to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special mediator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned president, Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhagus floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxes and abruptions several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelhagus there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate, if a piece is broken down at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice-ice and icebergs does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only slightly, writes the UK research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth biggest Schelhagus of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we don't know any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the record," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C shelf should grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so many of the Antarctic ice creams have fallen in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and is therefore one of the quickest regions in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle is still lacking in personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, showing concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation for only one year, refused to express itself in the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Because of the conditions of drought, the lavender is declining because of the insect-transferring insects, which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence said: "the lavender in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The weekly Riodoce collaborators usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the Sinaloa State due to organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the corpses accumulate in the whole country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012, there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with spectacles or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder's Attorney General was built in 2010 in order to address the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolent and although the terrain is now more avenger.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we are distrust to all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated by "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mouse oleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "" "for her reporting in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I would like to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPI award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could cursing like a dockyard, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love to the routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret startup and landing ways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrongly, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then things have happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the members of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before have been announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were mandated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers, who called the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went into the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenses, which was concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled all the political levels almost throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become more phonetic by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez goes away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers found out that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to better interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The stunning preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and armors about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that the evolution favor the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodosshrier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age must have been," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and mumified in mud.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Department, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the Black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeably the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being secretly licensed to publish diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2, is called a Becoming Stresemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her professional competence in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and dissident dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about her identity as a woman since puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde perig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't attend this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse became an unequal public, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President Chelotti would turn judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump runs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to develop new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stubborn circuits he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said" "" "things happen for a particular reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is with a heart) an end to the "automatic dispersion whose basis is sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic book mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she emerges with a hands-free telephon in his hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when she was supposed to do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to perform surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C suite leaders and direct to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, based on the innovative Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convergence has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convergence companies can send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, "Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convergence has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the Convergence company uses Convergence, problems that have previously been hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practicality.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees' Commitment in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical offences caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology for monitoring ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convergence offer your software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Gitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer's Venture Partners and raised his total financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High wages and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are well worth, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain renders if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes do not come fast enough, or not at all, this can result in disappointment and demotiation.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have been too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow people," "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after obtaining feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Fent River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian 'new' castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, cast it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the era of English Empires, maps that represent who possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the ornament Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, who produced his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be a crook, making money again and again and spending money for things they couldn't afford.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the head of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the ailing track on which the tourist train runs.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race shuttle, construction work on the track should begin this year according to data from the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this connection, especially for tourism," said the secretary of state Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big issue at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FFRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpo dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "customize" "" "his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern slings have developed into robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the RoxxxGold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like Frigid Farrah, which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "RoxxxGold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female attributes, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True to its website True Companion Roxxxies with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxies?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notice their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who praises to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the daughter's eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no background or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything, which could disturb the fantasy of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the words of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Do you like a big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the mp era that the political divisions that have polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, in the USA, there were papers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump close relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to let our filter blisters bursting.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of the Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom it knows, including the Republican kinship, with which she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but in another context it seems to me that this also entails significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump but the destructive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk about" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the scary possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active Nostalgie for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Habitat's Carusel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scary and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clipping music imparts this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not very happy about the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - it is a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karussell is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year old, an 11-year old and two women in the 40's can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have reviewed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologizing, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Because of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to the first dead prison sentence after a criminal appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">However, a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is prone to inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to find a type of tolerance supporting immune cell in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food the more they had these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel lieus, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, but had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial flavors had to do with mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a gut microbiological and they did not develop these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers gave L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potential high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was issued alongside a boat from Maine, a Wisconsin fire station and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Review relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen leaves for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication against the German press agency, he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican magazine" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "are measured when reporting on violence among the dome-cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the grips in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scarepia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarepia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you like to go to the church and that's a boned Fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that" "" "punches have been a completely normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of the abuse pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memorative book "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger's protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report that the Ulrich Weber appointed by the diocese Regensburg has presented with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "" "with high plausibility" "", "67 domaints sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of a high degree of emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, may even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on the protection of property at the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many pupils stand out for their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a cholercian and perfectionist, who became palpable in the oil, when a cathedral-record brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is precisely eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence in the pre-school were also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, experience it too late or have not taken the first indications very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domotatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "salvation," "" "" "" "Heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">For example, the vast majority of Georg Ratzinger's vast majority puts an excellent record, describes it as "warm-hearted," "honest," "honest," "competent" and "intelligible," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always been moved from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to burst outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just squeeze with chairs and put the key ring on the ground, but also gave ear-cowards and too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself had promised himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his retaliation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced it in a secular school, a high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually is in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, it is true to Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "there are no translations available." "" "there is a question of whether it is not his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still busy diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, there was much talk about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger published in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of the offerer's representative for the others," "" "it was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even confide in parents and siblings, then it would certainly not be a chorus master who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the rate of the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an inquiring disciple put it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it was imputed or clear or even more open than in front of their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion:" "" "that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "so he cannot be accused of having prevented him from being hindered or brought to the ad." ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violence excesses" "" "was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former master master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the reporting to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clearly separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, let's say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers events from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys were regularly harassed and portrayed by sadist teachers, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he didn't get the boys on their faces until they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was how most of the witnesses stress, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisical" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the dome gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in spite of violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Only Georg Ratzinger consistently shears his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome of the dome, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the capital punishment would continue to be practiced at the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">For him it was difficult to assess where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was not until 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "fall-snare of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past with today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what was breached at the pre-school on resistances and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the then usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I am happy that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take refuge, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, that is to say, ear cowards and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of testing also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone you do not make a great singer and before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, underground, deep-believing and heartily good people, from whom you can't imagine that he could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen. he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until now, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, father-like teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and whom they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clearly: all you have been accused of are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which was just published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attraction would be to make a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
