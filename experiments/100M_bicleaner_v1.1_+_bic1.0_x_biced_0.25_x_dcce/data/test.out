a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who was recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim testified that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , sharing the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ cia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as Chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and sympathy are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ cia admitted that Frank lived at Host@@ els first , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
combining his way with his family was to make us cook something , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has any information in this case is asked to call the SF@@ PD concerning the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in a drawer
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers or getting stuck on the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ chy . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , pre@@ m TV with good de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , she asked the question of the wish of children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25 .
golden Lan@@ ger receives the Py@@ ramid
his experiences on horses are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pole of sport &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to feed trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding career ended up again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself be led by his family about the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even fly for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports @-@ aid handed the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala the Golden pole of sport .
the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man is not lacking in awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sport pyramid was long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior talent for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US master s@@ winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the host Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the fen@@ cers Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports le@@ agues came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the show stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton represent a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to remain small and cau@@ tions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ wind regulations , and he is doing a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton on the other hand says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the future , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ to @-@ word .
the democratic applicant never announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp , party @-@ internal discussions could be given .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the US and the US do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also be better paid , for example Clinton is calling for .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
she wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is facing growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him , thus the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every blo@@ ated woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until it notices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems to be normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ v@@ ented women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten to torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are ste@@ aling away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ our@@ al mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tractors , for example , require a bottle of water to demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they &apos;re in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters are often considered inferior and at worst mis@@ used .
this means that around 90 percent of women resi@@ ding in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , requests B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some say no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , alone @-@ lighted women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ assed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or will men and women stay together , it can become - more and more - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection , one can read the rush they have on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new employment campaign measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the Assistant Doc@@ tors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour action measures in their disputes over a new treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called on its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testified that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty .
in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently paci@@ fied &quot; problems , which led to the refusal of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In light of this , the J@@ DC committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and demand official re @-@ negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour action measures beginning in September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors had struck six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A resident Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he informed BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with the reason that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be enforced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iled and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , however , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved in such a way as if there had never been anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but a lasting au@@ d@@ acity from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was hot .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia .
the crime was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ se becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a v@@ eh@@ ement , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most sincere were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his ministry last month with a failed state coup .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response .
in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ p@@ able to benefit from the cool atmosphere and l@@ essen Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus to ask for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow to be a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; two countries that have been rejected and treated badly by the West and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they did not even dare attack the issue .
the President of Turkey ordered it deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO &apos;s member shut down the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock market listing on Nat@@ West will be changed .
the brand Ul@@ ster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor base and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we concentrate within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched those brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ man , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ering when he makes a victory on Pre@@ par@@ ison
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone which only a few reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lls fans for years for this sport .
Frank@@ ie told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6.000 gains , if he would not only be a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole bunch of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived an airplane crash and received drug prohibition .
three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.00 years of age .
Russian Putin Mo@@ ved Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed the Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
for many years IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special En@@ voy for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it says that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s deputy since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief manager and staff manager of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants of Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff rec@@ eded at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of struggle for power ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust job posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V assumed the post in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
as Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his resignation in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will not be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a man of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were ej@@ ected by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incl@@ ine cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the building site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky job which requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total deck decks at their place and the last section of the deck today get a concrete beam for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate since the toler@@ ances that the team were working on were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ meters on each side .
luckily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming , while their boat had moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around it and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of its reach , until we let the water flow , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , the boat released the boat from the person who was steering the boat .
someone is watching over these men today .

together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move on leaving the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments of Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken a lot more seriously in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action plan living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in agreement with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , will provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
despite this , such as Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is worsen@@ ing .
if the action concept is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is still not complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose support will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 flats .
in order to prevent this , according to journalist Nicole Palm , budget@@ ary connections should now be purchased from the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one blow , the problem could be solved .
for in the west @-@ city the dates of Fri@@ sten are coming out for the year .
around 1800 apartments could be picked up back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , it is removed from the aim of so @-@ called confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , has been pla@@ gu@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , which are followed by a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game , when it was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the market launch , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look appealing .
however , the significance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who exercise sports regularly reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y gam@@ bler who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be rewarded with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world while helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ sie is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the floor .
the whole line is brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast r@@ cl@@ ed on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es performs on the Swedish Bar during the solo multi@@ player campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ sie is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while she holds her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown , and her long journey had come to an end at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ sie has dominated her sport last three years , 15 world championships - including 10 gold med@@ als - including so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
it awaited them a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between picture and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after they have won gold and silver in the single multi@@ player campaigns of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ sie took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of retired man coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ stein insi@@ sted on never having planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their bottom exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 she has not lost a competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ a led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish wooden beams and ground tubes - in which Bil@@ sie holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was still one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed in shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground exercise , she cast kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as accounting is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot during the listening to the music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first serial kill@@ ings of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told us that triple murder did not seem to be the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like most of his age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I have not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not true at all -- of course , one has gotten into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband , Vincent and her , has been told that Ed@@ mund might never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund said for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked all the time , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding give rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected throughout Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the South of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used across wide sections in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches may fall in this area .
in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the meteor@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the area near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream in@@ undation in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these flows only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the reported rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still tied people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved by the Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose sharply overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said to Hans@@ ford that she never saw such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapidly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer arrived near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably su@@ cked by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the failure of classes in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 in@@ und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were now flooded .
the leader of the commune Rob@@ by Miller told the authorities that the authorities saved 72 people and seven animals washed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to lodge the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants for taking part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but not reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ cked out of bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police for@@ et@@ ells that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun@@ shots , including in the lo@@ in , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at the hospital when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has undergone a great deal , his tiny body was kno@@ cked out of spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reported to the radio station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the wounded men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with the fact that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various storm rif@@ les , approached the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were leg@@ umes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seem to have been several armed fighters involved here , who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Philadelphia police station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on her arm when she was playing in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house .
it reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ ast and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turns , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon is round off , makes everybody proud .
this team finally mirrors the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one of the female gymn@@ asts was an African @-@ American .
last year there were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but this is what gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country do not look like .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female dancers in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily come in private trainers who are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asts .
we have to offer to the churches countless young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years ago .
during my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistants who voted for election rejected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident doctors are asked to receive a new contract containing changes to night and calendar workers to improve the maintenance of normal movements .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance doctors said last night in a message with : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by discussions were motivated by the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened in a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the resident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out other work campaign measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants a better weekend compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ combat measures do not reach little , but they have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only cares , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the assistance of the assistance doctors and responded positively to concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant reduces the risk of repeated cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE regulatory body recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE regulatory body recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that make plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that con@@ j@@ ures up blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , resulting in a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , established by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month consumption of 90 mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture allows electoral fraud to blo@@ om in Muslim regions
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly ignored as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on account of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an anti @-@ cor@@ rup@@ tive king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes to put non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they vote their votes in order to prevent someone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only for election fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial corporate culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in East London .
last year , a special voting court ruled that the acting Mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he particularly vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including conducting exc@@ uses to prove the identity
in its report it states : &quot; as evidence it has been pointed out that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or ban@@ al background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists manipul@@ ate letters to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
ban that political activists manipul@@ ate full postal elections and envel@@ opes from postal elections .
the police give authority to set up lock@@ outs for voting stations .
a change of the law , which facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Pres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English is allowed in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff enforce the rule that voters go alone in the cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices than un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy After K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic champi@@ ons in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed at the French cycling champion Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ driver of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only athlete competing in gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the American team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides Kate &apos;s dual @-@ driver on the track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the American team in the Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures , on which he looks very similarly to the Wolf of Wall Street Star , emerged .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great resem@@ b@@ lance with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I suppose it is a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ go@@ er for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver medal Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans to be an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory placed in the room : according to this user , there might be a reason for the couple &apos;s simil@@ arity
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their cont@@ ent@@ ment that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the American football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nes Gab@@ by Douglas , showing her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of its comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swimming woman called &quot; like a ief &quot; and died during the race like &quot; a pig . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , going down like a ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swimming woman Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor resting , which allowed the Canadian to fill the gap to China .
spectators all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hat der C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old woman from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yi@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , where many were talking about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after , Scott Rus@@ sell , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with people responding to the B@@ emer@@ t on Twitter
comment @-@ mate Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to her as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark swear by a woman who sham@@ elessly searches in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf again .
she continued to browse and pro@@ mul@@ gated four pairs of pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she pulled up and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and rehear@@ sed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , pulled up again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone looking at someone - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I witnessed , the workers have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had bought her and went out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself against armed attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a nearby distance .
whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to twist the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
if you approached you from behind , then you should be turned as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder to face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er is squee@@ zing against pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike it with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
with aggres@@ sors approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , seize the weapon and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
place the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip before moving backwards and setting the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it &apos;s like in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is the saf@@ est way to over@@ ride your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right ab@@ bot for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by le@@ aking out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ dic@@ ated his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a traction toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aning every object , he used a lumin@@ ary to show himself and us what he is going to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public hand@@ rails at train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely to a sample
in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ ometric score of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick himself after their lumin@@ aries were over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I ordered him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung &apos;s social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irre@@ parable condition .
the walls pointed holes , wooden boards were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated at the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired .
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ fes and flights included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden boards were torn open
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing deleg@@ ated her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t talk about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it had failed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was conven@@ ed at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the out@@ stretched page of the Municipal House , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step that considers Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been courageous in us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and medi@@ ate the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the floor
workers of the property management will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by earned a fine after having become guilty of the owner of a class B drug in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti @-@ coated .
the police says that it is les@@ see les@@ see who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police told us that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal terri@@ fied after an eff@@ lor@@ ent military jet flies on the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers at Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life
an portu@@ guese p @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air of the Air Stri@@ kes put an unbelievable storm
the air strikes admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was present
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent jet r@@ ushes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost within reach beyond the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped on as they naturally started to worry about the noise of the nozzle systems without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese airlines announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility conditions , the jet flew lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , however the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke , which limits his vision
the airplane was on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique reli@@ ed on a clear decision in this respect and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen was the first step in most of the other applications .
in front of the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not yet able to convince even at the 3rd : 2 at the trial stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after the extension of the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Espa@@ ña .
with so far , Barcelona is the winner of the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in an own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
thus the World R@@ ank@@ ings First took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ dom@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to finish the Final Game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their guns on top of each other in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the Mat@@ ches up here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said in a logical way .
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the Chinese flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ prem@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using Match .
but nevertheless , enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ dd@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had been inj@@ uring a cri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; finally &quot; had to settle with tin .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had , by the way , become in a similar high table tennis player Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp dre@@ amt of &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire did such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside the republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high @-@ bur@@ sts w@@ add@@ ling
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ usa in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equ@@ ated by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered as well .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if at the end , for reasons of political correctness , it is not enough for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp should have threatened to withdraw funds for the support of his campaign , he should not present any better survey figures .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more inclined to seize the Congress .
three @-@ ster Sc@@ am at the Dop@@ ing @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes thre@@ aten after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan shareholder had informed that the former S@@ printer and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert own investigations , and shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following IO@@ C measures , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the Dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Commander , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing procedures for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was stran@@ gely advised that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA accepted Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is consistent with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had requested in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this type of sport it became surface @-@ covering and systematically sub@@ merged .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , like Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and met the role of Mary in a night@@ mare .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli ad@@ mits this compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the dolls came to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
it is the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as back then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to the information of her family , she died shortly after she had for@@ s@@ aken the war @-@ torn country and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the East of London entered a plane heading towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can Senate in the Senate has been blocking Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate of Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge on Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telec@@ on@@ ference that he was expecting Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to be a naked calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine separates himself from Old@@ school Play@@ boys , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
it seems that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality counts on mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh en@@ cro@@ achment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already over@@ turned Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with criminal sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are fle@@ eing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the vain coup they added secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the association compla@@ ined about the specific settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Union called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire mark as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ es , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks had already issued the largest group of asylum @-@ rights approved for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this amounts to 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and , therefore , just under 29 per cent of all as asylum @-@ entitled persons ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no wage for war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum claims according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from government side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
until 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not be held directly at the end of summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as yet it &apos;s not going to be : summer holidays , heat and ag@@ ri @-@ elections - that bites itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers traveling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count towards the end only lab@@ ori@@ ously .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again passed an election campaign to the people passing by .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls .
it will be exciting how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the Coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive active campaign , you can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just like his legendary key@@ boar@@ der Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , sea @-@ jum@@ pr@@ ing has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel bears the blame for the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has speed@@ ed up the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like when at the wrong time it is the right place to campaign .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the North @-@ East @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and before shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so co@@ king co@@ ke , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that on the country you brush the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign co@@ king Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : the bri@@ ghtest , golden weddings , every birthday celebration has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called on his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of vac@@ ations , and largely lay their campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the country @-@ president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green elec@@ tive warri@@ ors go on search for local vocal ch@@ ats among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ es straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and finds it beautiful also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
b@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything quite a bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
at the beginning of the week , the construction site could be moved to the south at half @-@ time , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the opposite is also commen@@ ded for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the installation of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of asphalt road in O@@ fan@@ ul@@ dingen has been cancelled and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from the B 27 .
the traffic passing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says Deputy Head of Management , Florian King , responsible for the management of the management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many routes were seeking and rather their Nav@@ i familiar than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality ampli@@ fied the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the location himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been scored .
the Fast@@ est was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
but since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue out@@ breaks in them leaves everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants he has hit hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales figures range to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release one half of his collabor@@ ators .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , responded with the note , the restaurant would otherwise profit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars are often overlooked because of the complicated flow of traffic .
if you cannot drive down , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
that his family climate comes back after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is bol@@ ted to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a thick safety package .
but what has an ac@@ compli@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they overwhel@@ m no one .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced that a new security authority will take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger information and weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère begins a second trial for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also does not demand anything that has any chance with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast processes for deport@@ ations and more ways of detention of people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of ret@@ ali@@ ation for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than up to now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some of them still seem un@@ extin@@ ct and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , given the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people were deeply concerned were not cl@@ inging to time in election campaigns .
the inner security is enormously shifted into focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly bearing in mind the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ ish dispute over the equi@@ voc@@ ations of the federal police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the heads of the department also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a departure from the double pass , he kept nothing .
we have paci@@ fied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own pack@@ et is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still be shown .
there is a lot inside what might cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ long itself on the topic of internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
nor does Volkswagen get off lightly .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action there is a whi@@ r@@ l around a term .
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand , VW , weak@@ ens mainly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as reported by the D@@ ax listed company .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide .
sales in Western Europe , the second most important market in China , accounted for 14 percent of the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
sales of brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase reluct@@ ance in some core markets by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British Parliament also charged the withdrawal of the EU , said a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is already off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is to be found .
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler could transfer a sales gain from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer put out a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal fin@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now warran@@ ts its German customers a guarantee of re@@ plen@@ ished diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Public Ministry last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ qu@@ iry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power does not take place after retro@@ fitting and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen , however , does not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; as it was said in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come into a workshop six months after the conversion , and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , there is an uncertainty about possible guarantees of warranty as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why VW do not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sufficient savings from wealthy depos@@ itors in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks is speaking of a single case and does not see a signal in it : normal savers would not have to fear to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are spending money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over € 100,000 on sight deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 per cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs are now transferred .
leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the board of the bank .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically impossible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Kem@@ mer , Head of Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele with a bit more luxuri@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it be@@ ware of free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region there are well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at present , no further banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which calculate a discharge rate for private customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who is buying records ?
lonely men of middle @-@ aged love plates .
before turning to the comment section , to re@@ ap it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ ary men &apos;s middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to age 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely pair of buyers .
it is not a hormone by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , holding a modest gray suit and ramp@@ ing wild before I stop , hold my hands and let &apos;s get closer look at it : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were based - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 pieces .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ et the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him meet on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium , people who heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of parti@@ sans of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds to go to a shop like Ph@@ onica , to see that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee scores from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I lick through a pile of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come first slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a colourful audience when I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz thunder@@ ed from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but nau@@ ghty psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale .
she tends to do a window mannequ@@ in than a buy @-@ in store .
it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to bol@@ ster the pants pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries such as panels .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they are dis@@ regarded , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their Thursday morning stro@@ lling through record shops on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while avoiding the star@@ ving look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who worries about the shoulders of a middle @-@ aged man .

French court re@@ jects offering of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court has rejected an offer from the Cal@@ ais authorities , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional deals , in which persons within the camp offer goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would represent a fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also testified that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely trace@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meet between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the camp &apos;s Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café , which is operated in a non @-@ profit way and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic age , Rad@@ mul@@ i Tony Martin will not be able to get interrupted .
&quot; I keep track of the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in silence what reasons had led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed lately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion who lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) .

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft did not agree on Thursday how much money is going for the take @-@ over .
Be@@ am started his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch other games while playing , but also grab yourself .
for example , they can give up to players missions and face enemies and provide equipment .
the game giant Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the employee of the Start @-@ Up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in Seattle until now , moves to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and head Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the X@@ box console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
t@@ witch was purchased by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which should be super@@ se@@ ded especially effectively .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , on accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary heater for the observ@@ ance of the speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can , however , be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : in case of un@@ interrupted measurement , its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as transit prohi@@ bitions after time , travel stri@@ pe and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved with every car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sh@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information provided by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by after winning a Fiji master class gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday night at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage in Rio .
Fiji produces a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , re@@ pressing , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to her in the final .
but independently of this , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , she lost any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sla@@ b will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fiji began mira@@ culously and dropped the G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one were running into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners walked 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ li@@ cked in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB have hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ edge T@@ ackle von Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the Berg of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it just stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute pour j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB was still un@@ learned .
this is the way it is .
GB completed basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant c@@ lan@@ cing in Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , flags gli@@ der and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame finished the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ushing in the grass .
earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown placed the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the coach of the trainer for a row victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ tial gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first ro@@ aring to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve that goes into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who set such a benchmark .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , her 3@@ 9th uns@@ killed commitment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph of triumph .
behind each gold in the herd there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no more help than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would ever survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances it is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to get better back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts on Williams who spent a nerve @-@ riding morning spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to record , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en sh@@ ou@@ ted &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go outside and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was a time ago in the original on in a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the con@@ ten@@ tious association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ tes stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , 28 of them as Managing Director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports approx . 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of Kirch@@ hoff , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are also water supply contracts for other towns and villages .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as water@@ atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions , up to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) , restoration of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there are always new additions , because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he settled the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the nit@@ rate lowering in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a loyal scar@@ f .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the rup@@ ture at the high tank at church lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained only because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man has a bald head .
the man should not be directly addressed .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot;
the victim was 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
at first the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no indications of the Ta@@ ther@@ or or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene .
steel - Light @-@ view for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity promotion are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing facilities for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag Edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent applies .
but this too will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written .
Gabriel &apos;s successful bid for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission allow@@ ances , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer country , China , faced massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , imposed import duties have effect on import steel effects ; on the other hand , economic prospects have spread in China .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the last analysis , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May the set amount was returned for the second month in a row .
production has been two percent year @-@ on @-@ year since the beginning of the year .
the association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing makes sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt he finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a senior choir .
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several points of view , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says from the German sen@@ iors &quot; league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because social and family structures often dissolve , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be ar@@ du@@ ous in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist writes .
for this reason , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not be out of the pu@@ dding too quickly in everyday life .
even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für Senioren @-@ Organis@@ ations ( Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für Senioren @-@ Organis@@ ations ) . in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für Senioren @-@ Organis@@ ations ( Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für Senioren ) e.V. , &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs ar@@ ouses many memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia care about long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also demands special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
even older people living alone practice not only concentrating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist .
when someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can simply join them .
many cities also offer over@@ views about the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ist .
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ ver on scre@@ am of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the ch@@ ew did not leave the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cats on the chi@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent more quickly to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) found out .
K@@ ater also re@@ acts to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed youngsters are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens pen differs from the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were watched from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a herd of little ones , taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition .
despite the low sample , researchers keep their results meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , responded to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Bar@@ um@@ ann re@@ reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempt to overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to stop football even before football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ dek@@ r .
accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ dek@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is made responsible for the coup attempt by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency still suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually does not affect the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan declared ended on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into adher@@ ents and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working clubs of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what unites the anger of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of the winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine models in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the front @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good @-@ bye in the Europa League .
in the South Bank of Li@@ g it only reached rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the season was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season ad@@ vices as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ch @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to continue on the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which had been signed by the AC Florence under contract , had made known only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the attempted put@@ sch@@ ism because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chef Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated € 7.5 million , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we can &apos;t pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite Dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice as a result of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swimming woman Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who compla@@ ins after a dop@@ ing lock her starting right just before the games , was ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her performance .
when it was certain that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a storm of applause .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio , despite the dop@@ ing past .
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice as a result of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running faster than before , and over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds he is the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to wait for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having demonstrated the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she suffered severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship , has been tested positively on the Pro@@ hibited stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ ing capture and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 meters , was tested in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
one means of penis enlargement had been responsible , eu@@ ph@@ ered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Sh@@ oot &apos;s throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been awarded so many med@@ als afterwards .
in this way , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing was established in it .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro 2006 title because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized , was returned to CA@@ S due to a judgment of the International Sports Court .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ ine was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Champion , hints for taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and went off on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already been able to leave it .
she was planning her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a shed .
according to the police , a Thai society was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives again went up , and another person was killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ating near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular during vac@@ ation@@ ing .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , a further bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police station .
after all , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the southwest coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be linked to the Islam@@ ist revolt or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received intelligence reports on im@@ minent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police told their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its website to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , no need to travel to these provinces is dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military considerable influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit themselves of having led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just under a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come into the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national defe@@ ats , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of the Freedom of Freedom of Fundam@@ ental Rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Vice President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , migrants in Islamic faith or the Middle East will be de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist fashion .
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ers in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they said , his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties are Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda aims to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , it had been given reports on the contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case - is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identifiable .
with a view to the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees shel@@ ters , Ma@@ yo said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be rights @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further legitimate groups or small groups are formed , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other far @-@ right extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German@@ ia @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be discern@@ able .
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
worried compla@@ ined that many requests went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene beforehand .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of the attacks on asylum accommodation have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many persons have committed criminal off@@ ences that were not at all in the hat with right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that at times it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then promoted to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was not his straight athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian received a Special start@@ ing@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
as most athletes are running in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ a@@ wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
memorable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to embar@@ k on a 100 @-@ metre outdoor race on his own .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp not so narrow the im@@ pending election defeat
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already given an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp is losing the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television transmitter CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .

the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
in brief , the Group plans to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric vans from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to engage in the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they will ship their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other farms .

GF@@ RP lead follows dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ markers came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uns@@ afe the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after more dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the global number five of the industry faces a human new start .
the Executive Board of Gf@@ K intends to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
on September 1 , the Executive Board Member of the Executive Board took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , and shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation as a reason for the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for details , a company spokes@@ man did not want to call it on Friday .
who will be conducting the market research company in the future , is still unclear at present .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ heads it was said on Friday that in the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago was big .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become uns@@ ett@@ led .
&quot; if that &apos;s the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company was unable to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
compared to the first half of the year , sales of EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million were shr@@ inking by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter primarily imp@@ acted the decline in value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
with impair@@ ments amounting to EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business unit , the Group secured a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .

accidents - Bus slides in tren@@ ches : eight wounded
eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( District Aur@@ ich ) with an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to him , had to give way to an opposite truck , which partly drove on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the persons were not able to leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the accident location on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ finished travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel agency .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will take place from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl sewage plant of 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after excessive calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the council &apos;s approval of the household was established by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ deck@@ ed for these wastewater facilities was reported .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ covering way .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ chen@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the money bag .
the increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board Manager Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a re @-@ calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market municipality was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overl@@ apping or under@@ cover of the previous calculation period .
Schmidt thus reas@@ oned that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water attack , which could be between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution base , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect .
in addition , wastewater generated in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expendi@@ tures , all three systems had a considerable impact on all three systems , not least because of their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for the world cup , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the az@@ endorf sewage plant .
the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up in the pumping station Wel@@ sch , and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the required supervision and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water waste in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully defeated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market town of great entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed in the waste water plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run by stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer association is not to be extended by these facilities because they are non @-@ profit institutions .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average fl@@ ation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect has been critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all wrong cuts come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critici@@ zed in the past because they were accused of promoting black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter remembered viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison decided .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose tweet was widely spread across the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and the least unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filtering effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been pulled to the degra@@ ding extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult for such things to go un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in Sn@@ ap@@ chat settings practices .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a staff responsible for under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she &apos;s closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual conditions on the spot , a committee of inquiry filed in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of Ar@@ med Forces of Ar@@ med Forces , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and Ar@@ med Forces Analysis , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence related information , typically li@@ cked off by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ es , regularly signed a positive image of American efforts against terrorism other than the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leading errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to alter the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com belonging publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of the sul@@ tan could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command tops changed intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans launched the Task Force after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the general inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced in a statement by the Supreme Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ret@@ ar@@ ded the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged mor@@ als under analysts , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ crats stated no evidence of interven@@ ing in the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were received by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the speeches of the Congress , while the general inspec@@ tor &apos;s investigations are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the alleg@@ ations of the past year , however , have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest app@@ rais@@ al of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Pri@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush resem@@ bled the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team confirmed that the government &apos;s declarations of air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , since these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger hat , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field of the women &apos;s field , show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after having fired three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , she knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Brit@@ ons , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group will perform .
as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising f@@ uss following their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey ra@@ cket in hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became a coach of the National Team , and thus things began to turn better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the close @-@ up area .
India had gone into the game without any victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball to the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and in@@ es@@ capable , a racing relay between competition and effort .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , that is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without having to hear about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the controversy between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .

Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could well have been among the known names sent to Prime Time by sponsor and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline tur@@ f .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pi@@ stol@@ len , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign long .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw your attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ ingly the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic Port altogether .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines jumping and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ scho@@ oling as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ istic bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El trampoline , meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging champion jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ ments ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram according to version , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a more ridi@@ culous finish in television transmission : those of the world or the Olympic record .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful endeav@@ our is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atical - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then upwards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the can@@ opy and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey would expect his new fan community to rin@@ se with air .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shooting and killing dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terror threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer at central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time tensions accumulate along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of fl@@ attering under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians were able to communicate via social media , since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians prof@@ ited that they were thus gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ered , which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is changing just as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ aque reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mel@@ es , who came from the North Ethi@@ op@@ ian Tig@@ ray region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a rebellion was in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections , which , according to the figures of the analysts , were apparently ban@@ ished by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts pra@@ ising Ethi@@ op@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal failure of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , controlled by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried last Friday to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who strive to take him into protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position which he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp , referring to the asser@@ tion on Thursday , insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day , in which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews he meant the accus@@ ation perfectly serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tru@@ mp , wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate would not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation on account of declining demand values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
later on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later declared &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then return it as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction is . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his asser@@ tions vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp accepted an estimated sound because his survey figures have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a major advance in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , took great trouble to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mps &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ markers , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton had served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ap@@ ologi@@ zed about Mr. Tru@@ mps as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once displaced by the price of the market , cafe returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shopping front was displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people mour@@ ned as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is change , it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ term employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural tears .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg past and visited the club regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb closed , she gave the coffee t@@ ine for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she is drinking coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he won &apos;t make a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business occupied the old business room .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice producer wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb suff@@ ices to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt told that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming felt .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt made a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land aqu@@ atic tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both historical food histori@@ cians .
CO@@ E &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese kitchen in the USA while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will be published Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ zzy selection in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ ney , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ dd@@ lers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways the country was dealing with , not to be the country of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le foods , the K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ discovering food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , since coo@@ ks could conc@@ eal un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the focus of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before , or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Pe@@ as@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the billi@@ on@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully alien .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in fla@@ vor@@ ings by Ms. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most te@@ dious food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its feet .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pr@@ elu@@ de recipe that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a fancy name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly to use a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E gra@@ bbed three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the line to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil prot@@ ection@@ ist who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , previously saved nearly 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life at stake to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , said in the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , to save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels of barrel above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .

Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ arks mostly come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average barely 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed .
this lifestyle co@@ ined by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long ago that Greenland &apos;s hair is st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live above all in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers in Greenland know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s disease .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ap@@ sho@@ o they measured when they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , who tor@@ so from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities in their lens nucleus , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re green shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , whereas the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156 , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks let themselves become apparent with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is no accident .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life .
construction grounds in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board received the announcement from Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ fication and settlement issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the building surfaces in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au address young families and other sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , builders can report right away in the town hall and the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to satisfy even requests for the establishment of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to am@@ end the newly created area plan for land use only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ timely lar@@ n , the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval has been given to them in the UK so far .
that is why we are using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs on the Main in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk basket ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can directly communicate with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it is just as bad as Dublin in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the economic researchers believe .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gains legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent Disp@@ ute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the drug company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ der and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was uph@@ eld on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took care of each other and claimed property based on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir zu@@ grund@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j close to the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) went through the city after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who buried themselves within the city .
they have delivered over 2,000 civilians who were ho@@ stages held by the fighters , Shar@@ ed Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the CS@@ TO , shared Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos;s presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; ex @-@ Minister Bill Clinton announced an income of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false dec@@ ei@@ vers and dec@@ educ@@ ators regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax returns , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check to the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter referring to the publication of the Democrats &apos;s presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp &apos;s special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
among others , Tru@@ mps critics , including the Republi@@ can candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions pertaining to assets , his donations to charitable organisations , his business angels and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which senior Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp will prompt him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politicians have reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very low taxes for two years , and a business journalist from the New York Times cited a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that people who pay more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check by the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax return showed that these only $ 100 of their income referred to as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income tax@@ ed $ 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements , they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many wood@@ p@@ eck@@ ers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is world phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with them much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom flo@@ ats up with a b@@ ang and spray the fine dust on the air .
a whi@@ ff is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a fire fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

the city council rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski factory on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bank , which is currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new business people , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director beats Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ordered his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel staff stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the alleged appeals of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was said in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel into the electoral list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ let against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police attacked tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ffiti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has increased sharply in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian enterprises take up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent le@@ aps and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation delivered some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , mainly vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
sought after : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest br@@ oil
on Thursday evening a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was perpet@@ rated at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed persons who had m@@ um@@ ed their faces were demanding the release of cash from the drink market &apos;s employees and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police do not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , thus relatively small .
the beverage market can be accessed directly from the parking area of the Re@@ we market and can be seen badly .
the perpetr@@ ators have to be scann@@ ed in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have escaped from the gravel parking space located opposite the parking garage with the silver car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , who stand in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of prey , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer release
eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the quiet Nau@@ heim Hard@@ tw@@ ald in the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it was rescu@@ ed by visiting the zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling .
culinary delights were provided to children and car@@ ers with their own prepared body@@ boards such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewelry pieces made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the return home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together , four stages were tac@@ kled .
in order to bridge the time until the next trip to Rome of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in the period of two years , the senior minist@@ erial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgri@@ m walk .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the open portal of mercy offered by the Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ene , and H@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the priests , were in their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and gave the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b , we went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started .
the single day tours were framed in the mor@@ nings and evenings depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a break in field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again in order to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , the parish churches of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and encouraged dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags : the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch , had to be lowered at first around 500 al@@ timet@@ ers and then climbed again after the heat .
in the evening , the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the bad@@ lands .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived in Münster &apos;s Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the metropolis of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
in the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Brit@@ on won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ cked to fame last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump took the legend pride when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Scot@@ sman , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was close after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation when Hin@@ der drove in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC @-@ expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they stepped on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the Triumph of 2012 at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a phenom@@ enal victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possible that he wins the victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be equivalent to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is the next one in the spr@@ int that will start today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , where Wig@@ gins will be in the focus .
yesterday he cont@@ ested with a commission@@ er before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ ell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Kor@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train @-@ wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas took place in the background , so the withdrawal of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of S@@ esto and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ stran@@ ts as well as retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the enam@@ el of Port@@ land based on the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as plant operators will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply contracts as the supplying energy company has announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to operate the facility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa complex in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 stations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loos@@ es money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging shops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , AG@@ L believes that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L said that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual sl@@ ump in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not affect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the melting furnace in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts in Port@@ land consume about 900 MW of electricity per year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the popular September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse brought me to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a wei@@ rd ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , kri@@ p@@ pled reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular Show@@ bi@@ z uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , ending with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é gesture of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference which is more similar to a book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut fashion@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to make a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ in@@ mates of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to go around on the mis@@ chief seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community Centr@@ es annually assign 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected per year by the municipal health centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair dele@@ tions and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s municipal authorities said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Community Cultural Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal health centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Minister for Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction campaign charges after staff re@@ port@@ edly recru@@ ited weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mps &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was shooting a gun on a staff while they were in je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the state court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pi@@ sto@@ l , put his right index finger on the trigger , and tigh@@ tened the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign leaders , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate un@@ le@@ ashed an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mps &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not act on violence .
B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint requires compensation from the campaign to viol@@ ate the duty of care and of Philip on account of bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip were equally out of place .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
he was not responding to calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the SPD and the CD@@ U ruling party are significant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could barely rule , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell down from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at the Land@@ tag with 19 percent for the first time .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens entered the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite light losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 3 per cent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag .
according to the survey , the Berlin Convention of Dep@@ uties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
at 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties for the first time .
by 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would , on the other hand , miss the entry in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in storage at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies of high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some Euro lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even though tor@@ menting slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone thri@@ ller experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and wound to Microsoft .
today , the market is domin@@ ating vendors that came all a lot later than Nokia .
be online anytime and anywhere , which is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app vendors and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet @-@ communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march was launched , and today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ taste .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive committee for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as it was in 2012 in London when we took a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ ais@@ is is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bling on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders had been wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn by economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw which implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass advertising block@@ age , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of ho@@ in and f@@ ro struggle between the upcoming open source community and the hang@@ ers has been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how al@@ arming indicators have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent study by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display blo@@ wers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
the company has switched to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m shared a spokesperson .
advertising on your desktop PCs is a big part of the revenue , so Facebook considers the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertis@@ ment tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks were al@@ arming new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we instead focus on Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman considering presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday handed over a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fell to the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was passed by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who invited them and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , shared G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not being held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was said in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having crossed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the judgment .
the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman - who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revers@@ al of Venus increases its day @-@ side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists .
although it was once inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
her oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ gen got away , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins Aval@@ an@@ che as trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy has res@@ igned on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to small co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it greater depth , it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly aligned with the organization .
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season Roy has been awarded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Best Trainer of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post @-@ season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference at five points back .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ en and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike a strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding remuneration for North Sea workers are subject to negoti@@ ators while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks , which will start early next year to re @-@ address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on account of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had been boo@@ sted by the decision by the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest employment disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ates in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary growth .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
in peak @-@ rotation @-@ rates these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have an braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
gra@@ ft compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
because the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there &apos;s still a lot to learn about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
g@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball stadium in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year deal has been protecting him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the resting place of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star admitted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio @-@ genesis sc@@ andal up to the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting funds for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even make me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not running sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; concludes Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ conver@@ sions of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Pas@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
blur@@ red : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Pas@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a wis@@ p athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Pas@@ inski were tested in Brazil positively and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically challenged athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the unknown .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday in Ch@@ en , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B trial and a hearing has been requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news so@@ aked through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive by himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O is to act .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the athlete by critic@@ ising the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ wei@@ ghted nation must not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Pas@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was also tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ on three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , however , they must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of the whole sport .
the World Federation , IA@@ AF , prohibited the start from the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , including the La@@ be@@ da@@ nation of Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming , the former clubs in China had also cat@@ ered for violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t at the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ ons on the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din voice , but had to wait for a three @-@ month lock .
data @-@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ acker its ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently attacking companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for extingu@@ ishing returns falls significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks resulted in a start@@ ling fast in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the requirements of the ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currency .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
the damage is accordingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely under@@ mine business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation during operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims per chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free @-@ of @-@ charge example files .
and if private persons are redeemed by payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate tight and pay five @-@ digit figures to return their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers .
the previous malware @-@ Kits were created by purchasing the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail is then looking for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
thus , one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissions one further to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals occupy sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that have better backing up their data .
over 50 percent of IT administrators in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful execution , the perpetr@@ ators will instead thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing pressures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could be quite a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit surface falls down somewhat .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l is available for high @-@ ranking and 10@@ 26 l with back@@ rest back@@ rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats .
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
but he is likely to make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine specification : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tested top variant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the security systems belongs the City emergency brake assist ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed as needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical for aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee roll in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of sickness : when does the organis@@ er pay
sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms .
in this case , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of her tur@@ f war .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their condition led the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective treatment plant which allegedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizers .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
in fact , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence done by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be dispos@@ ed of and determined at the same time to react to terrorist dangers .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
but if criminal offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , this increases safety and also the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is meant to improve the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ce@@ ase@@ fire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which makes it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently discussed Swiss duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the Newspap@@ ers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality before .
he considers that a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules , for example in traffic or for witnesses to the court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ f@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway service provider
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the right @-@ hand h@@ ackle should be extended .
this is good news for all car @-@ drivers who are in traffic jam every evening when driving across the motorway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße by 700 meters .
drivers can then cycle directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic is divided in early times , thus improving the entire course of operations on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes drivers particularly nervous between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ a path and sometimes beyond .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; needle öh@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from here , traffic is guided only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt more than three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load force , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected factory @-@ daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible state operation cannot say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official period of residual life by 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal waste storage , the country has deliberately chosen the weaker time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site will be past .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule studied the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s Home Forest School has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the staging in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster during this project .
between September 2015 and March 2016 , most of the young people of the class have come to Münster , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg in tongues , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without a refugee and migration background should have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical distribution are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany at night a stroke through the calculation - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star scales are per@@ pen@@ ds , which at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their names because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
rest@@ ful night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up rings .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute about one quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and various causes can be underlying to them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ uth , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ let and pass @-@ through distur@@ b@@ ance .
just the passing sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board in the German Home Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications .
sleeping disorder is not often an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors compli@@ ment each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie down badly , wake every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , reveals the process .
the impair@@ ment might look different : one is down@@ cast , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly a low @-@ lying sleep doctor in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary bedroom medical center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why you should first contact the general practitioner when it comes to sleeping problems .
this can be explained by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of abnormal wear@@ iness , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etz explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after covering , you go to bed at the normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling of the dor@@ ms .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws for a better sleep .
the process counts : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first brought gold to the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler decided via Facebook to protect his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king € 150@@ ,000 no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night .
the pumping system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls however are very good .
as a result , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look very closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ r would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be kept with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not attend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the election ham@@ burger that meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de arrested by Lu@@ ggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civilians from the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years old .
the susp@@ ects had made several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and pan@@ elling ste@@ els as ban@@ anas .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past the@@ fts of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and had been a collaborative , collaborative and professional approach .
the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ate Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the di@@ ver , who had been submitted for comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they had carried out a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few aven@@ ue trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new dwell@@ ings will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , will , however , be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime the inhabitants have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel died several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ res s@@ mi@@ ths , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground , locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners .
on July 13 , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers took off under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves in the evening .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who nour@@ ishes three children here , is mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the residents of the building projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ens left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police force between the residents of the household and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer road close to the Riga .
while the Mainz was evacu@@ ated under large police regulations in a ver@@ itable breach of the road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from around the world .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on inv@@ oked pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; autonomous power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours think of this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality . according to statistics , criminals behave almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the crimes are damage to property , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ancy chamber in addition to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which were certainly not .
the famous burning cars , too , are no longer available in the Old Riga .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal Brenn@@ punkt , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved into the streets of Riga - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the clear@@ ness of the city district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here people are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ up , who are anno@@ yed by colour bombs : the building projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub life , which can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the administration team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else mis@@ ses .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the un@@ finished wool mel@@ ee , which has a problem above all .
this meant that some - less mo@@ cking - aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job .
he was looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an un@@ finished wool mel@@ ee .
but administration is not a central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le thinks .
most of all , it is about organization , work with local people , as well as behind the scenes as well as networking .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honorary and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection to the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired resi@@ dences .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the county council to the municipality and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private dwell@@ ings .
so far , it does not work , unless you depend on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communities must be strengthened as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments is it not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed home , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do charitable work - and that is motiv@@ ating and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , too , administration and volunteer work jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can make a sense of brid@@ ging the time , for example with language courses .
if you develop a feeling at some point , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the client is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fears of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach , after the recent incidents ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the perpetr@@ ators were completely dis@@ credited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials must look for activities on site and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
