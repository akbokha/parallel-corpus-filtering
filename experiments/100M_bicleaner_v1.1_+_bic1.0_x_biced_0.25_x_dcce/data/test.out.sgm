<seg id="2">His experiences on horses are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pole of sport" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to feed troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led by his family about the system of ALRV, on a horse he did not even fly for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports-aid handed the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala the Golden pole of sport.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman is not lacking in awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurel, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sport pyramid was long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means very much to me," says Langer, "for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting junior talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master swinner was added to the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton represent a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "as a doubt, Trump wants to remain small and cautions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively rewind regulations, and he is doing a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton on the other hand says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, Trump and Clinton say almost word-to-word.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant never announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, party-internal discussions could be given.</seg>
<seg id="17">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposed trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the US and the US do not want to isolate the international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be better paid, for example Clinton is calling for.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rushed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is facing growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him, thus the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiled smiled and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved in such a way as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a lasting audacity from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was hot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousse becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a vehement, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most sincere were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his ministry last month with a failed state coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this week, state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pipable to benefit from the cool atmosphere and lessen Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus to ask for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow to be a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders," as an analyst once described, "two countries that have been rejected and treated badly by the West and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they did not even dare attack the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey ordered it deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO's member shut down the Russian jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin Moved Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years IVANOV was part of the tightest confidence circle of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, it says that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Ivanovs's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he later became the chief manager and staff manager of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants of Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff receded at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of struggle for power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entrust job posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV assumed the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "deck blower" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incline cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the building site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky job which requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total deck decks at their place and the last section of the deck today get a concrete beam for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the shutter represents forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances that the team were working on were tiny - they were just a few millimeters on each side.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we are in agreement with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem," "" "Bratmann said:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, such as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is worsening.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is still not complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments whose support will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been plagued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon, which are followed by a GPS and, once they have been found," "" "photographed" "" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when it was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the market launch, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look appealing.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the significance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise sports regularly reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumpy gambler who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be rewarded with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world while helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast rcled on Thursday to the multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles performs on the Swedish Bar during the solo multiplayer campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilsie is the fourth heterosexual woman who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth while she holds her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown, and her long journey had come to an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilsie has dominated her sport last three years, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited them a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between picture and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Bilstein insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their bottom exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has not lost a competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa led through two turns, the picture was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish wooden beams and ground tubes - in which Bilsie holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was still one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears streamed in shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise, she cast kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday. it is expected throughout Saturday with more rainfalls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the South of the Mississippi River flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flooding warning system is used across wide sections in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches may fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In southern Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it was still raining in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the area near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream inundation in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these flows only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the reported rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi national border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still tied people out of the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved by the Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another step-son who lives near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said to Hansford that she never saw such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities, and he would be the only one to swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they stayed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flood" "" "rapidly spread" "", "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer arrived near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground has been considerably sucked by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure of classes in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS affiliate WWL reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa attacked 200 inundated houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both of which were now flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the commune Robby Miller told the authorities that the authorities saved 72 people and seven animals washed by the floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to lodge the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants for taking part, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last great flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum from the city administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it rained on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded, but not reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnast and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turns, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon is round off, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one of the female gymnasts was an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year there were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is what gymnastics throughout the country do not look like.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will only have four female dancers in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like gymnastics are a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily come in private trainers who are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are located in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the churches countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you, you motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on account of" "" "sensitivities to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special voting court ruled that the acting Mayor Lutry Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="18">He particularly voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including conducting excuses to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In its report it states: "as evidence it has been pointed out that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or banal background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a nearby distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to twist the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approached you from behind, then you should be turned as first, so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder to face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with the knee in the groin and twist while the attacker is squeezing against pain, the weapon out of his hands. strike it with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">With aggressors approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun, seize the weapon and twist it so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Place the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip before moving backwards and setting the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and litters of a serious test by leaking out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abdicated his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a traction toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaning every object, he used a luminary to show himself and us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the rinsing button of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails at train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely to a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminometric score of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick himself after their luminaries were over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "Lass us Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I ordered him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm happy that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents lactic acid bacteria particularly associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after delogiation with a damage in the amount of £50,000, because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed holes, wooden boards were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated at the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strifes and flights included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden boards were torn open</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delegated her and her partner forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was convened at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the outstretched page of the Municipal House, rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>

<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous in us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and mediate the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">After an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately announced to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan shareholder had informed that the former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic Village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has asked the IOC to obtain information about the case in order to exert own investigations, and shared an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures, IAAF will evaluate an assessment," "" "stated in an IAAF explanation." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the Doping control station and presented himself as Ferguson Rotich, released and signed the rehearsal," stated Kenias Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics Commander, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC following numerous doping procedures for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls presented by the IOC in front of the Rio Games, it was strangely advised that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA accepted Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is consistent with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had requested in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this type of sport it became surface-covering and systematically submerged.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything quite a bit," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south at half-time, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite is also commended for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the installation of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of asphalt road in Ofanuldingen has been cancelled and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is resumed, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from the B 27 on both sides from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic passing through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says Deputy Head of Management, Florian King, responsible for the management of the management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many routes were seeking and rather their Navi familiar than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality amplified the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">But since the construction site has been moved, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue outbreaks in them leaves everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has little consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants he has hit hard. "</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, responded with the note, the restaurant would otherwise profit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars are often overlooked because of the complicated flow of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot drive down, it is also elsewhere beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his family climate comes back after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.</seg>

<seg id="2">In spite of diesel scandals, the delivery numbers are rising worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand, VW, weakens mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as reported by the Dax listed company.</seg>

<seg id="9">Sales in Western Europe, the second most important market in China, accounted for 14 percent of the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth.</seg>

<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British Parliament also charged the withdrawal of the EU, said a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the fumes first escalated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is already off lightly by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales Fred Kappler could transfer a sales gain from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">At this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now warrants its German customers a guarantee of replenished diesel models." ""</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power does not take place after retrofitting and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before turning to the comment section, to reap it under the pseudonym non-Allemonary men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the re-emergence of vinyl records is not a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to age 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely pair of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not a hormone by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, holding a modest gray suit and ramping wild before I stop, hold my hands and let's get closer look at it: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings in which once independent salesmen were based - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), revet the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and once again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him meet on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium, people who heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of partisans of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds to go to a shop like Phonica, to see that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee scores from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I lick through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come first slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "opp," "" "dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a colourful audience when I go in." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz thundered from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naughty psychic traumas are hard to fix when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She tends to do a window mannequin than a buy-in store.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to bolster the pants pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some as far as it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries such as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they are disregarded, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops on Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while avoiding the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who worries about the shoulders of a middle-aged man.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer from the Calais authorities, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional deals, in which persons within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would represent a fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also testified that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of calm meet between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the camp's Jungle Book Kids "Café, which is operated in a non-profit way and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which should be superseded especially effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-acting Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, on accidents, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to renovating bridges with temporary speed police, there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary heater for the observance of the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can, however, be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: in case of uninterrupted measurement, its battery lasts five days, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit prohibitions after time, travel stripe and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the state-of-the-art condition, the trailer can be moved with every car with trailer hitch according to manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measurement mode, so that the wheels in the armored and incidentally also shoughing outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to information provided by Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-day rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji produces a master class in handling, side-quilting, repressing, line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Bok, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to her in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, Fiji had defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost any game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this slab will hurt, but progress is amazing." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and dropped the GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one were running into driving busses. the World Series winners walked 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau frolicked in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hedge Tackle von Mitchell halted the Berg of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute pour jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB was still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB completed basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant clancing in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Seas, whose fans sang, flags glider and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame finished the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown placed the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotintial gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first roaring to the last, 220 tough pieve that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who set such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th unskilled commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the herd there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and there was no more help than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would ever survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory her first thoughts on Williams who spent a nerve-riding morning spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that might be a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>

<seg id="9">Now he was retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports approx. 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of Kirchhoff, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are also water supply contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed as waterattendant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions, up to emergency interventions at weekends," "" "said the chair."

<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), real estate purchases in the area of the new wells (1998), restoration of the high tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the redevelopment of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there are always new additions, because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation they praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he settled the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>

<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can be maintained only because one filled the high reservoir of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing facilities for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Freitag Edition).</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing makes seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt he finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several points of view, Erhard Hackler says from the German seniors "league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often dissolve, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be arduous in a positive sense, Hacklist writes.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this reason, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not be out of the pudding too quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für Senioren-Organisations (Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für Senioren-Organisations). in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für Senioren-Organisations (Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für Senioren) e.V., "says Ursula Lenz from the</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia care about long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people living alone practice not only concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hacklist writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something long, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hacklist.</seg>
<seg id="30">When someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews about the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hacklist.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured when detonating near the beach of Patong, which was popular during vacationing.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, a further bomb exploded, killing a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police station.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be linked to the Islamist revolt or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "in recent days, the authorities would have received intelligence reports on imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and place." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bomb attacks, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace that was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its website to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military considerable influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, will benefit themselves of having led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just under a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows Robel Kiros's courageous appearance at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that at times it was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was not his straight athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old participates in the Olympics?</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater will take place from October 1, 2016 for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl sewage plant of 3.44 instead of 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2,18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the council's approval of the household was established by the Councillor Kulmbach that underdecked for these wastewater facilities was reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-covering way.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welchenahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the money bag.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increase in fees is between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Board Manager Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a re-calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market municipality was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overlapping or undercover of the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt thus reasoned that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, which could be between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the low distribution base, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, wastewater generated in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenditures, all three systems had a considerable impact on all three systems, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for the world cup, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up in the pumping station Welsch, and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "these extraordinary expenses came from the required supervision and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water waste in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were" "" "fully defeated" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market town of great entertainment costs remained spared in the waste water plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long run by stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewer association is not to be extended by these facilities because they are non-profit institutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect has been criticised as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All wrong cuts come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past because they were accused of promoting black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter remembered violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime-comparison decided.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweet was widely spread across the photos that the filter was "hurtful and the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filtering effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crossed this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user, "it's much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat settings practices.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a staff responsible for underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "Zhu said she's closed her Snapchat account and added," "" "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not O.K." "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when it allowed the actual conditions on the spot, a committee of inquiry filed in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of Armed Forces of Armed Forces, Secret Service Committees and Armed Forces Analysis, reports of great discontent under Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence related information, typically licked off by high-ranking CentCom commandees, regularly signed a positive image of American efforts against terrorism other than the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leading errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to alter the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom belonging publicly announced that a military reconquest of the sultan could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command tops changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the Task Force after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments regarding ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "he announced in a statement by the Supreme Demokrat in the Committee of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "retarded the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged morals under analysts, and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats stated no evidence of intervening in the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were received by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the speeches of the Congress, while the general inspector's investigations are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of the past year, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest appraisal of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Priker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush resembled the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team confirmed that the government's declarations of air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger hat, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the field of the women's field, showdown with Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having fired three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Britons, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group will perform.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss following their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey racket in hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without any victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and leaped the ball to the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inescapable, a racing relay between competition and effort.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, that is passed from the wristwatch to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without having to hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the controversy between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well have been among the known names sent to Prime Time by sponsor and feel-good TV advertising if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympic trampoline turf.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistollen, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw your attention to the discrete charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparingly the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic Port altogether.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in trampolines jumping and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a Clownsschooling as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonistic bling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the spanish El trampoline, meaning" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging champion jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to take a number of falling movements (turning, pike and ointments) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to official Olympiaprogram according to version, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a more ridiculous finish in television transmission: those of the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful endeavour is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then upwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the canopy and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley would expect his new fan community to rinse with air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions accumulate along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of flattering under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians profited that they were thus gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas prospered, which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Meles, who came from the North Ethiopian Tigray region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands protest against elections, which, according to the figures of the analysts, were apparently banished by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praising Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal failure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, controlled by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin balancing act." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried last Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who strive to take him into protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump, referring to the assertion on Thursday, insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump, wanted to help mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate would not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation on account of declining demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later declared "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then return it as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction is." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his assertions vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an estimated sound because his survey figures have gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a major advance in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, took great trouble to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backmarkers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton had served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats apologized about Mr. Trumps as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>

<seg id="10">They show culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frizzy selection in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackney, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich foods were very popular," "" "said Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach such as lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women cooked for male riddlers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" records the ways the country was dealing with, not to be the country of Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central theme for Americans," "" "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casserole were staple foods, the Kasserolle as a "wonderful way of rediscovering food residues," Brickman noted, since cooks could conceal unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focus of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "" "housekeepers" "" "and to meet the challenge of turning pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic treats." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa Peasant cuisine of his kitchen, he spoke like the billionaire man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully alien.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Eleanor would have asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in flavorings by Ms. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most tedious food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of wasting food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>

<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dived somewhat reluctantly to use a spoon in the tamed, brown glibber.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-arks mostly come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average barely 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle coined by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "explains Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected long ago that Greenland's hair is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-arks are hard to observe, after all they live above all in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers in Greenland know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's disease.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentapshoo they measured when they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers, who torso from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-arks had normal carbon-14-quantities in their lens nucleus, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre green shark showed an age of 335 years, whereas the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156, Greenland-sharks let themselves become apparent with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme live above all in icy waters is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon stuck on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were tackled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next trip to Rome of all the ministrants in the period of two years, the senior ministerial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrim walk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the open portal of mercy offered by the Freiburg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greene, and Higerloch, and the priests, were in their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, we went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were framed in the mornings and evenings depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a break in field crosses, chapels or churches again and again in order to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parish churches of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and encouraged dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tags: the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch, had to be lowered at first around 500 altimeters and then climbed again after the heat.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the deserved reward was a common barbecue on the badlands.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived in Münster's Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the metropolis of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner racked to fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jump took the legend pride when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they only took a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed as they saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner scored an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was close after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation when Hinder drove in a higher gear to slow him down and to allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC-expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the Triumph of 2012 at the site Kenny and Hoys Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said Hinder:" "" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny it is in the realm of possible that he wins the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equivalent to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is the next one in the sprint that will start today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28 year old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will be in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he contested with a commissioner before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Korsoon of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train-wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas took place in the background, so the withdrawal of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sesto and Mobbingvorstrants as well as retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks as if the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as plant operators will terminate the energy supply contract and thus raise all supply contracts as the supplying energy company has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year, no further subsidies to operate the facility." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the Alcoa complex in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 stations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "" "hedging shops" "" "that should have come into effect from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "for this reason, AGL believes that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL said that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual slump in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "did not affect." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the melting furnace in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that some 600 megawatts in Portland consume about 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché gesture of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacant brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning, but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference which is more similar to a book than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut fashionista were of the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had leaked before the official announcement.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>

<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called them "the mistinmates of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to go around on the mischief seems to pass at the point.</seg>

<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before it realised that" "" "this would not happen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "the director, Earl Philip," "" "drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and tightened the run in Vincents Kniekehle," "" "stated Bordini in his indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to the local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "weapons must not be fired to harm harm," "" "stated Bordini." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate unleashed an upheaval when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival should be elected Hillary Clinton and appoint judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trumps's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not act on violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordi's complaint requires compensation from the campaign to violate the duty of care and of Philip on account of bodily injury and lasting mental damage.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms which resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow reversal of Venus increases its day-side of the sun for nearly two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When her hydrogen got away, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotates in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planetary growth.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">In peak-rotation-rates these poignant stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have an braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Graft compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the constellation of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Pasinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Blurred: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Pasinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wisp athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Pasinski were tested in Brazil positively and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the already critically challenged athletics competitions these news come to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday in Chen, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Criminal Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the opening of the B trial and a hearing has been requested.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires Chen's full co-operation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news soaked through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive by himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the forbidden substance for the blood doping agent EPO is to act.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported to the athlete by criticising the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-weighted nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Pasinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was also tested positive on the anabolic steroid Nandroon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, they must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the Danekova case is another heavy blow to the reputations of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation, IAAF, prohibited the start from the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, including the Labedanation of Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, the former clubs in China had also catered for violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "if I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt at the French Radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014 Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champions on the Trimetazidin voice, but had to wait for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-lau: so perfide compress hacker its ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently attacking companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for extinguishing returns falls significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of malware," "" "says Malwarebyte head Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks resulted in a startling fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the requirements of the extortioners.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is accordingly higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely undermine business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation during operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure explored the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims per chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt free-of-charge example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed by payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate tight and pay five-digit figures to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual extortioners.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-Kits were created by purchasing the malware, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail is then looking for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions one further to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals occupy spammers with the spread," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that have better backing up their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of IT administrators in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful execution, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing pressures," "" "said Malwarebyte head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blockaded heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit surface falls down somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only a trunk of 453 l is available for high-ranking and 1026 l with backrest backrests, but there is the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is likely to make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine specification: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the" "" "Executive" "" "tested top variant." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">To the security systems belongs the City emergency brake assist (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and throttle the speed as needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol station from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep well before the wake-up rings.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute about one quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and various causes can be underlying to them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weuth, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Disorders and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inlet and pass-through disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the passing sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board in the German Home Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleeping disorder is not often an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in depression," "" "says Weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors compliment each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie down badly, wake every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, reveals the process.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment might look different: one is downcast, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly a low-lying sleep doctor in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary bedroom medical center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why you should first contact the general practitioner when it comes to sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be explained by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with respiratory failure, in case of abnormal weariness, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietz explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After covering, you go to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands on the ceiling of the dorms.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The process counts: regular sleep and stand-up times, not sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few avenue trees, in between still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a Bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new dwellings will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, will, however, be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the inhabitants have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel died several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadres smiths, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown landowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers took off under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who nourishes three children here, is mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority police protection from vandaliens left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin senator and the police force between the residents of the household and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers" "" "district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz was evacuated under large police regulations in a veritable breach of the road, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling liners from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on invoked panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "autonomous power" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours think of this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality. according to statistics, criminals behave almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the crimes are damage to property, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenancy chamber in addition to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars, too, are no longer available in the Old Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal Brennpunkt, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the clearness of the city district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here people are rather people who are not so well drunk," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-up, who are annoyed by colour bombs: the building projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub life, which can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else misses.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the unfinished wool melee, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less mocking - aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an unfinished wool melee.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not a central area, Annika Deuschle thinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all, it is about organization, work with local people, as well as behind the scenes as well as networking.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection to the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residences.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the county council to the municipality and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, unless you depend on private apartments, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communities must be strengthened as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed home, there are internships, apprenticeships, school courts, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that is motivating and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and volunteer work jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can make a sense of bridging the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">If you develop a feeling at some point, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems also," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and the client is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fears of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent incidents?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's client quite clearly," "" "what some naive may call." "" "a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the perpetrators were completely discredited.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials must look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
