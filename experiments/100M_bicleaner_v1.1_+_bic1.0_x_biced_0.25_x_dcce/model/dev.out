Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and bl@@ ames Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal raised by Obama about the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , some of which was rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to with Obama , a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a loud voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said Lamb had made the disa@@ strous call after some time after@@ ward .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting in the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students were saying that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had previously mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies toward problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic route to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that can no longer answer the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane later , when he entered Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the University of 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did a doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ ships lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have obviously been together for some time .
in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both present in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter wrote and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes an entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night saw his guitar and harmon@@ ica piano finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , initiated the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Carlos Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss still described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for the holiday season
To@@ ys R Us says it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip them with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox joke about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and an arm &apos;s length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and movie theaters in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the conflict which lasted almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the margins of the meeting &apos;s minist@@ erial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey data showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at surveys down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate @-@ mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising up Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as the J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize the tur@@ key per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollars flow in order to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that the real estate market is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shri@@ mps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; values have turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate market positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first nation @-@ electoral state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament pas@@ se to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters adapt themselves to the idea .
when they expose their schol@@ arly hats , Republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush at the end of July .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters see the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp will beat nearly everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mps leadership , while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp the majority support is harvested .
he ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush , 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one really can say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as immigration is in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently also do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ ways .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son have now accounted for around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish upset . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; here in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hob@@ s@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the street , one square meter of a that@@ ched roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start with Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to make the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - and then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Wit@@ ch@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28th 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller received the help of Olympic champi@@ ons from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto in the Champions League for his 28th matches , which allowed him to pass a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium - and the Munich talked about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pir@@ äus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went brave , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely penet@@ rated the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k kno@@ cked out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then , by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked on his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant play , Pi@@ raeus became a con@@ i@@ fer .
but on the door@@ step Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .
for instance , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ leg@@ ged friend with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back in muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had given green light only after the final training , said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardian decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still made one .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ ed Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block evidently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : in doing so , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , up 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time by writing the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the hazard again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained Er@@ itre@@ an Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good oral health until old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists present rel@@ ics from the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhine villages
archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a specialist for archae@@ ology .
archae@@ ologists were found in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard .
it has already been known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which belonged to the church .
young woman of freight train collected
after a young woman is injured at the station in the direction of Gei@@ frau@@ dul@@ chen Lin@@ der , the Federal Police asks the population for help .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
to raise the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
thus , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish government plans to include the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new International Criminal Court .
they should come from the same parts of the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against prejudi@@ ces .
so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , according to his own data , she wants to work towards an International Investment Appe@@ al .
for example , there could also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration Proced@@ ure ( IS@@ DS ) , which is mainly demanded by large corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , over which companies claim compensation for damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first position , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Secretary of State Matthias Mahl@@ knecht ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
during the reform , the Commission considered key points which Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out with other EU foreign ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration may be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the timi@@ dly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ousness and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative ir@@ y@@ man .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at all times .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and breaks positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece is released in 2005 .
exu@@ ber@@ ant of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album enters the Bill@@ board charts and is not included in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sales pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still orchest@@ rated widely , but is supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since long ago the smaller clubs came up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the glo@@ omy ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs there , the distinc@@ tly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only in addition to an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under ro@@ aring applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s qu@@ iry
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s qu@@ iry with tension is expected
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is expected to make his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions and for the first time he wants to join David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain in silence during a memorial service on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several title Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ ons have refused to serve as leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference told Labour &apos;s changes to remove the whole idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow working and pensions @-@ minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory leader over the last decade , across the Dis@@ patch cabinet across the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different set of policies , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subject to &quot; skill &quot; and the stri@@ fes of with@@ ers and instead focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic affairs , will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the survey was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pounds increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound increased le@@ aps after data showing an increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and calculated assessments at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after receiving the offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competitor group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had opted for &quot; sell &quot; the rating for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after reporting a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster puts Lebanese on a potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ine owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there has been a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wers in his store , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multi @-@ cul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been registered with the German Patent Office at the patent office in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is well received .
Met@@ aal La@@ un@@ ches Off @-@ Resistance Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
Met@@ als tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ als launched a ground communication campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail dealers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ als and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice producers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes rehear@@ s@@ als in I@@ GA stores and sell shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Met@@ als is expected to release more details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler performs its annual Investor Strategy Day for food , alcohol and equipment .
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA dealers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail dealers could lose 360 $ million sales every year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed @-@ cost basis , could cost around € 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ als lost market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leader of fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ als probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ als refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ als contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 IG@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in terms of sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler however def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programs will be put on to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and , according to the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious engagement with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison calling out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite knowled@@ geable about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open due to a cra@@ mp but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he gets tough , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent component into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition , not all the controversi@@ es round about , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick made the climb very quickly , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stand and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants trapped in a No Man &apos;s Land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip at the street between the two control points of the countries and erected tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels did not agree to a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the un@@ cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency stand rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even prison mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck in many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence which the government allowed to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve of the military use of the military which is expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos fo@@ stered the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to edit the data of people and press a crowd to sit down there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway association between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground against her .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is going to run for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some gains .
Clinton has a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections decreased .
their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters in the local elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the primary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s back@@ ups also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and adju@@ dic@@ ation are also cited .
as the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage will increase ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about voters .
similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ er sel@@ ections emerged as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics with voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server remain in office during the term as foreign minister , most democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion even though 36 percent said their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for her under registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to elec@@ torate do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voters throughout the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush tend to be hon@@ our@@ able .
a majority regards S@@ anders more likely to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide pol@@ l near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tru@@ mp on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . supporting growth of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son jumped 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the bottom , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son advances in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp took some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask about Tru@@ mp &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holi@@ day@@ makers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .

five members of the Brotherhood have bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania during a religious ritual , murder charges were submitted against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood were brut@@ ally attacked by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go beyond a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call for the call number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contacting Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to conc@@ eal their utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ lic@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning due to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment concerning murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the town council .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the house@@ keeping will fall , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so severely that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could , however , find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at a historical trend based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things for a while volati@@ le .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that fortun@@ es are deduc@@ ted from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate increase , fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on stocks tend to occur later in the growth cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 % , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the value of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made an interest rate of F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all hei@@ gh@@ tening cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers were put into the shadow very quickly after the onset of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far it is 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic direction .
bonds seem to change the direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the loans arrived immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
highly @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tightening has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
large and large companies will benefit most of their business operations in the United States , benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet recorded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the radio because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to BBC Music Awards and said that they only mim@@ i@@ cked The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice and said it was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that private sen@@ ders do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEPs Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen also said that the public law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly will no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ Director @-@ General dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and public education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder was needed to engage the public as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production that , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports , came under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
he added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall , &quot; if the next time it starts a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August at slow@@ est pace and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed down expenses in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales de@@ xes .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers picked up their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that £ 5 had been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ closes the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Ben Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were worn by the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mek@@ ka &apos;s major mosque .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days ago a building crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the beds .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi King passed a san@@ ction over the Ben Laden family enterprise because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 operators who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to visit the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , would not have allowed the crane of the crane to stand when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s guidance abroad was forbidden .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the p@@ addle that later held this month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives did not stand for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal decree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mosque as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been linked to the Saudi @-@ Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ contr@@ ite son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people remain in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has seen a rise
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , are opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Brit@@ ons settle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople who carry out the work in their homes
if you can skill@@ fully use a hammer or a brush to paint walls , nowadays you seem to be a minority .
because the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique L@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which have more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that accounts for exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group sh@@ ook the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new outlets .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and collection avoid@@ ance on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Municipal Court .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused decided that in 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used money from the association accounts which they could dispose of in their functions for private purposes .
he damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial failures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was divided between the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the defence argued that , at no point in time , an asset was created to the association .
sports officials had only paid expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club , &quot; said one of the accused , in the B@@ read @-@ based firm of the financial office .
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the payment of expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
that is why one has paid off part of the expense allowance until years later , namely from 2003 when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detail entries appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts administered the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said .
why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial geb@@ ack , it is important that only the freedom of debt has been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigations for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this security account went to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one had known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary was justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim repar@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the official said that he never obtained a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and diets .
in Di@@ ets , he charged the Association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not prove accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer preserved after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all the fixes must be made in cash , so he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces some 30,000 jobs
in addition to the down@@ sizing of the company for three years , the Compu@@ Tri@@ ese will build more jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop from the fourth quarter .
the 5@@ 5.000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share sold 2.3 percent .
the corporation , which has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is now spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led even further in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers for its services continued to be the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo .
in the third quarter at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP is responding to changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive footprint .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would predominantly rep@@ el rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are against intervention in the conflict .
cooperation with Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad declined to 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this .
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second day of arrival at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
the fair will focus on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and e @-@ mobility by September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organizers of the Auto @-@ Association V@@ DA expect approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wer against several hundred re@@ porters .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break@@ out at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ thro@@ wer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the function@@ aries first replaced pe@@ pper@@ mint .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees drow@@ ned and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves , if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Associ@@ ate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances against such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death squ@@ at at Delta State University la@@ gged ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he can undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said he shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give it .
lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doctorate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , such as his curriculum vit@@ ae on the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ sive years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly calls for his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
in 150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives , group conversion will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgraded the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and redemption syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
in the future Lufthansa Cargo is no longer responsible for the passenger business .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the Executive Board team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employee was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual revenue of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike on the court .
this shared the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted to come as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa Cargo is moving to the Euro@@ wings group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline in the fight against competitors .

Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this made the left external def@@ enders to cry and close him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ rom@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , does not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerning this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the British Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better than the Lor@@ ax ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the Super@@ Camp@@ s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , re@@ stores a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; amidst the walled city of Th@@ itz @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment by the monetary gi@@ ver , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , need stri@@ ck@@ oning Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snor@@ ting creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a ward victory .
the A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at Test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully if he will hopefully kno@@ ck out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good results , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ rics got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance lies now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up highly .
he is an X factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared and I didn &apos;t mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ treats immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him , he really impressed me as a young man .
people may view his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the news is in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot took a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit Great Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy runs into a dol@@ ly by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ elabor@@ ated ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently dis@@ cour@@ aged on Tuesday for Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on their own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain outside the EU tent , &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point in some major cities , no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has been done in the exagger@@ ations such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a failing force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
hence , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ or@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did not have it during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , h@@ acking foreign lands and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never for@@ given him this .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn &apos;t need time to waste on me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild juven@@ iles of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ anism can say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell told , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties for all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the hu@@ stle @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a withdrawal campaign - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which reminded me of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling on Monday .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Product ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants told the meeting to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an economic financing in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he also took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes should serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking is equivalent to two billion pounds per year in the National Health System .
by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up on the East@@ coast , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er- and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to make public @-@ legal programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and Sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had tried to come into contact with the BBC for six years in Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio cost , which I think in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide a possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financed programs that could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think it would reduce the BBC in general .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former conductor of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ erin should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal &quot; N@@ ish programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfil their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this .
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said just little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking to public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ age of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channel , which respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace de@@ basement stimulation , an invasive procedure that converts electrical impulses into the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the cube cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultras@@ onic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from easy nerve exhau@@ sting to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ atical year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like contrary to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and decorate their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking on it .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close through che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something to you . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck down .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in jail .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the Glass House in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly caused her neighbours to sleep for two hours before pl@@ es@@ ing their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come into the same student residence by chance ?
conver@@ sely , if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , would you like to get rid of her , dis@@ connect herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she passes all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good rom@@ p is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but do not ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ opp@@ le their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ parents , Ger@@ ling @-@ ear@@ ners

&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dwelling space , but also the only mother and the ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner atten@@ ds to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds pen@@ thous@@ es for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great part .
in view of the stream of refugees , we need sufficient living space for the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one places people in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees are saying it is again peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have handled my project correctly .
it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments , which could hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good building today .
that is why it is all about .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s Only Dev@@ ise : full Att@@ acks
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only one motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup II emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the World Champion in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far and will also start the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent exploration should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the club club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ sans Office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations it is possible to take part in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information will receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years , we have been demonstrating with our ambul@@ atory care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also hardly many benefits of insurance companies , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ín and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both executives particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined at the inauguration ceremonies , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the reconciliation in old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar surroundings .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 noon .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not have an intellectual understanding .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meadow r@@ ushed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the civil servants and threw it down before the feet , as reported in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the City of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether the meadow will be shown or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , followed after the police told his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck him with his fist in his face .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al gland and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped out of his sacrifice .
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car to their apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured rode in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a beat , one re@@ applied to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the wounded had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
until now , there is only a vag@@ ue t@@ act description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over office breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , lack happiness : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ den@@ breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is at a half @-@ point next to his successor in the next few months .
after a conversion period Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lowship of Fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ bei , who is currently completing her vocational training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mu@@ eller pleased the idea of running its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the tr@@ ash bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC &apos;s willingness to find fault @-@ free Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ breaks is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to sit down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ bei . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speech room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is allocated to the land@@ fill in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25,000 euros ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ stra@@ dung each quarter , in the northern German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another family practice .
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had found himself , she would have gone too .
who visits mil@@ ler &apos;s consultations , inci@@ dentally also still looks at familiar faces : he takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always been pushing for gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple enjoys two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being elevated to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia Pla@@ ins &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - denied Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to move on arriving refugees to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up cor@@ ridors for refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to leave its borders for refugees but not to be smu@@ g@@ gled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
since then , according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles constantly meet new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country will reck@@ on with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , the Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far . Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to encourage people to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , it could indeed be the predicted shift in the previous Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ situated route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct rigorous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since gone through a good testimony to the country , regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local ophthal@@ mic appearance in Hor@@ gos : he preserves the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock market h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have been part of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketing and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the information obtained , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other defend@@ ants were in this case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , partly fast steps , sometimes cozy .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large pla@@ ques with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid paid attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce support is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteers .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and read the phrase about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; suffering not long , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the margins small discussions develop about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me eventually the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant of Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband promot@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly disclose themselves on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still stuck with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .
an estim@@ ation that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ enses .
the death and funeral atten@@ dant is among the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid sought an honorary official , she immediately reported it and was there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ alia belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ enses can cope well with her job and the experiences and experiences gained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows training , training and supervision of death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
trainings for new employees are offered every two years .
the tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there , other personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gi@@ ants lowered his profit prospects for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower outlook comes despite the price increases that amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid earnings when considering weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , bringing sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter sales of bo@@ d@@ water transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
the mur@@ al of the United States is threatening above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices holding steady here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented financial incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economic data show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate raise would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic advance would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level seen by F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation went steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation , when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is neither the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , at that time , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , commented this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial markets movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates a rise in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on US growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest income statement .
the most recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets stir up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
ja , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .
yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .
the market / camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the walks .
if the whole purchase makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the bar@@ ge ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has various taking options .
what there is here : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ e@@ ze the fish and even if desired for you .
a good part of the store is the massive freezing section . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pig @-@ natural intest@@ ines , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercial prepared food and more .

you will find here : fresh mon@@ th@@ ong dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it &apos;s located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe für Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the dedication of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 conferences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is entirely different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pedi@@ atric Organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building proposal for the sports hall 2.3 million .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ h@@ ello building at the Bern@@ ina sports grounds move forward step by step : in the most recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously protected without any major discussions .
previously , among other things , the body had adopted an application for a construction @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid plan of cultivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a non @-@ con@@ centric first and roof over@@ hang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of planning is to use the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again about the inclin@@ ation , which was prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike the plan of cultivation - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of cultivation appro@@ ves no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the inclin@@ ation - although the Bern@@ ina Municipal Council generally tends to be restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Turn@@ h@@ loop construction is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at the costs .
subsidies are expected from school and width sports promotion .
in the next stage of the proceedings , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ large hall is now presented to the Council of Govern@@ ors for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this matter will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority of fishermen and the existing internal station should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change was triggered by the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game , who agreed to take the lead and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team as of 1 October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
by way of passage for the next two years Fischer will be working with his team , if the supervisory board agrees to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , contradic@@ ted ru@@ mo@@ urs about which the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I continue with the property , J@@ och@@ ar @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ time sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ balls of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ische HC .

hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police told them .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
det@@ ective police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missed since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police cleared on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old captured on Tuesday evening also applies , who , in fact , admitted the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the dead bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having arrived at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first launched personal items of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was put into the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be presented on Wednesday to the Haf@@ hop@@ al , the investig@@ ators put him to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the further investigations are alleged to bring about the close circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing short@@ com@@ ings
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable place .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association of Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Res@@ idential Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are ready in Germany this year .
thus 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble upon the housing market and fall into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Statisti@@ cal Office of the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers in the last year lived .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the study also poses considerable short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a budget deficit which will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 living units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in flat areas in large cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohn@@ bau &quot; proposes a restart .
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for housing construction .
thus the tax exemp@@ tion tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
furthermore , according to the Alliance , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the subsi@@ dy programme for the Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already well received by towns and villages .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
in Hungary there is practically no escape , since more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north with no hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Internal Affairs , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which came into force on the same day also make decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across a border fence .
the border strip contains other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , however , after the closing of the border hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 attacked people .
just before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are subjected to the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence .
in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Agency , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ations &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier guards were disman@@ tled and one of the camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to sell himself to the goal of this conversion .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria gains only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still living in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people await the on@@ ward journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor went &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train .
because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly hired rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we first tasted the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with snack and drinks .
we said straight away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the stra@@ ined train passengers switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short @-@ term announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued , but still to try the border .
the regional train was set off at the river Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the previous day a two @-@ brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent thousands of thousands to us now is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp to help build structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly highlighted the position of the Hungarian government in the sphere of national socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers in view of the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria to be uph@@ eld .
Konrad searching for 3@@ 5.000 district lod@@ gings
Konrad , with the refugee support , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first commercial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen was already under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday were also accommodated , said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year .
in order to fulfil the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations need to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Bund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the regional leaders .
they would have promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also demands great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that suppliers have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodating Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own source search has not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at present , since the persons concerned are currently under investigation without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in the event of an emergency , however , further locations should be checked for their suitability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the Mayor for sharing the refugees inside the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has cor@@ ded further action on the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the protection @-@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria again takes control at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the behaviour of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz Industrie@@ zeile is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wishes to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million has been invested in the facility by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been le@@ ased to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center for 60 years from Linz AG .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ our opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually Jutta has wanted to get a dog .
this project had to circul@@ ate the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , it has now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets have to be purchased from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the upper room of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has left Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most impressed when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into a hand@@ bag when looking at a hand@@ bag , the specialist cannot answer with last safety .
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful bag will enhance every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose residents are called investors .
this property also unites some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign @-@ hostile attitude , concerns journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ eur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to it via -@@ zig places .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del sp@@ un a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which alongside Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz also counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is &quot; a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a radius , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the investors , they say .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the investors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was first estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homes for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not take Tru@@ mp , because he was ch@@ ased without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the padding , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ son was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ aker retired rather dis@@ soci@@ ates the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp will be coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast @-@ show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five major cities compared to the current 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August Today it reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise is on an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change are affecting the morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are ok , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children along the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , revealed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 came .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second night of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly have obviously who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped by the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed till the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and observed Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to him un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent requests for their impressive open @-@ day training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne to the ban@@ ker for the rest of the game when he lost a fight as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by league converter during his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his lap@@ sed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian union had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and kept an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn convention in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger , warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get recru@@ iting in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free voters &quot; state parliament postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commune .
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voters &quot; meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there was during the war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we don &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W head critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts off , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the national politics in the city of Great Wall shouldn &apos;t fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lasting long @-@ standing torch remains on the order of the day : the educational policy .

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a long distance of trend @-@ free and nervous trading history .
only in the afternoon was a clear opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the MD@@ ax mid @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ oriented Tec@@ D@@ ax climbed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the benchmark for the Eurozone fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also recorded the trading posts in London and Paris .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index ranked roughly 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to be replaced on this Friday until after the interest decision in the US and also to the big decline in the fut@@ ures fairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , RW@@ E shares pushed the debate on the burdens of the nuclear phase to a record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered a bit , but lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
on the D@@ ax head , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investment in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the official papers of the Daimler and BMW motor@@ ways increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on the stock exchange securities securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the Euro decreased in the afternoon to last 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber stories in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ ani district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police took tear gas and then fired into the air before they fell back on rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ onn@@ i say that new provinces which are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the law@@ makers have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den &apos;s town wants to market an approximately 4,000 square meter site in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wait for appropriate offers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what investor is inqu@@ iring is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , no contracts had been concluded .
Em@@ den has had a part of the land , which is located on the street corner / corner of Great Street , bought a few months ago and had to tear down the buildings on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the holiday Sett@@ lement at the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ gli@@ ders are further wor@@ rying - they fear the outlet of their Freizei@@ tre@@ fu@@ gi@@ um
months behind closed doors were negotiating , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday Sett@@ lement at the Small Sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective client , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; publicly unveiled its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , produced the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the Board of Directors at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant ring overlooking all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that the traffic will increase tremend@@ ously by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of the bus loads must come so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the area of a large area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans were still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign which aims to raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations who will help thousands of refugees who over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ate call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / or $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes may live longer after losing weight surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven to be efficient in treating type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies were conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I amongst those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same time at 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely solved by only one percent and at some two percent in some cases .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decreases in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for individuals with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the US took a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 that swal@@ lowed up strongly alcoholic hand@@ des@@ infection agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand des@@ infection funds in children under the age of 12 reported to report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube indicate how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few spra@@ ys can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer within reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four spra@@ ys of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally regarded as dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor treating her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ump@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand@@ held disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
apart from alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing the disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand des@@ infection agents and ban@@ ishes them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; squ@@ ab@@ ber@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan and prescribed disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was refused by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bored Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not just about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stands clearly at the top of the table with five points lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly like that - but we have to continue .
we really need Celtic support , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is clear that the decline in the field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to tro@@ t again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen didn &apos;t have to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ ross in order to win a seventh consecutive league victory which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who haven &apos;t won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising altogether .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ing with the process
since the security staff could not satisfied the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breath @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in custody first .
why I witnessed an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would ple@@ ad him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man following damp police pursu@@ its persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a polic@@ eman who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a domestic peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what &apos;s best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt hyp@@ e testing at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I waited a long time on it , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ ammer .
if that is the case , they should certainly remember their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and does perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and inf@@ ringe upon me , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching added that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ disputed master of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening .
it could have been that day the whole day , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man in Cob@@ ram after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and cur@@ ator .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with heavy injuries by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia visited the police station in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ sing and under @-@ blown assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations about ring fight
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators invited the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ ised comment to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ king lim@@ b of his team and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tackle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the review of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always comes up - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about ring@@ ing when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year round . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny as it always occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premier league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ dious team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and don &apos;t have any points of tension ?
for me , it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee for Dru@@ gs
a man who may have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 damage deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ated his Australian and his Serbian passport , who reports daily with the police and is holding a cur@@ few between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
a truck driver was seriously injured during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn to the left at the last moment , as the police told me .
the crash culp@@ tor &apos;s cab is completely disman@@ tled .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was sleeping , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computer found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , saying that he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to the charges brought up by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the rules on 25 January and did not appear before court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im requested that Ho@@ gg will not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders since they argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; may be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from the judgement until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added before the date of the judgment to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the Schle@@ user caused fear of discovery and sei@@ zure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot across bridges and traffic lights to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
according to Federal Police Information , the Munich Central Station increased significantly more refugees compared with the start of the week on Wednesday .
approximately 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; Exp@@ ected in the Sou@@ thwest
met@@ e@@ ologists warn against storm ra@@ fts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
the strong low pressure is the prec@@ ur@@ sor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has been dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in particular in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , there is still a Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the bulk makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars are especially popular , which are currently selling very well .
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations were accounted for by this segment alone in August , according to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( from 17th to 27th September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel presents a new entry below the largest competitor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available in five @-@ door versions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kom@@ bi &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which can be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what will be driving new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra Ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a Com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan stri@@ pper wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is powered by gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is given by manufacturer &apos;s data at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented above all hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a number of re@@ visions and new variants are added at the IAA in the compact class , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has dealt with an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Institution of Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties may even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on free foot according to his law , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his term of residence because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges appe@@ aled the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest for compensation are author@@ itative for legal reasons , there was no compensation for compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a der@@ ail@@ ment of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of joint damage .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
so they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet is in@@ humane .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner of decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in the last few weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin had also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included in 23 hours of aggression , which increases aggres@@ siveness , even for fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of junior staff , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept her .
what &apos;s going on in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers are expected to enter Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : from 60 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing per year from the rental price , and to these particularly favourable homes , refugees will also apply .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to arise and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the record company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Ru@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognition of work .
while there used to be a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , the asylum seekers are limited to a residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of shortage of qualified labour - the view prevailed over several times that refugees should be enabled faster access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
so far there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the establishment of networks is , therefore , according to the Thr@@ u@@ ster of the Royal Road to Work Integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few married parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; for their parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared in classes with no knowledge of the German language .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ ate St@@ afford &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says of the Berlin School Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing asylum could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a common currency or tolerance do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law , if they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter , in principle , do not receive af@@ itt@@ al because they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to death .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this gap of financing needs to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk are demanding .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
in the future , Islam will play a more important role because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively adopt the same rights as churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the central council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society much more in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a universal equality law for a decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ Series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention have to commit to Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says doctor president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end health cards immediately after registration .
achievements could be expected later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited performance catalogue which the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law prescri@@ bes .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier first of all .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency out@@ patients .
and with another diagnostic look .
in refugee children , for example , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
but with some of the other symptoms German doctors come from their education , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and as far as medical fishing is concerned , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications , and possibly again disc@@ ard ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates of the German psycho@@ therapy chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee group arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
who suffers from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration difficulties , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
up to now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can make an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , teachers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to capture each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites to dream in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst Family for more than 33 years .
thus , the gift of being a servant lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst starting his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of Circus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
also the Castillo brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily accommodate them .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ iness .
balance your balance on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it does not go well with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read off after every wish of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege .
the upper@@ most command therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst Family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst charges its performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also as@@ cri@@ bed by statements made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had bu@@ ked him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reductions will result in a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ available , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the depar@@ ting from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger insi@@ sted on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere illnesses since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury quote will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a prolonged period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a turn inside the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the distant expectation of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves now is even more desperate than ever before , as to prove suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ edness ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 is announced as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though the isolation is actually dominated .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health far more deeply .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone mind told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ent role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
as very my objective out@@ sider state over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give it a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the royal park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met for less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ k missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which held a 2 : 2 tie at the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti Pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , before he passed by Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who fell in the first half in no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the post ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a lef@@ tist flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern recently stood before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times Champions League winner , two times Club World Champion , twice European Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now telling him that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça should sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid gained everything at that time , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered member of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he has got me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca at the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the grass , the red turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and finally celebrated the triumph of the King .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in reference to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown was shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress from The Mar@@ tian prof@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to think about it - whoever will be the director always - how they deal with the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a bru@@ te that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 vi@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task included climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge completely three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit &apos;s Detroit .
formerly they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon hon@@ ed his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two points , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) clin@@ ched 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and allowed three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had hit three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ log at the end of the seventh round , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who has a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale run in the second , Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was the major league in the Major League 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a Double Play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn , Detroit created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ alled S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit ap@@ plau@@ ded for the start of the game by a Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the injuries list before the game had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the game to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big hit , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a Walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the decisive re@@ thinking about military options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he submitted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military stake in Germany .

tens of thousands of refugees passed the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria in recent days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong influ@@ x of refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , that Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
Merkel under@@ scored those people who needed protection , also compla@@ ined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead @-@ eye view &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view had been strongly shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or emphasized that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling stret@@ cher routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of migrants reported on their way to the Greek border .

accordingly , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is small , yet too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ press beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thereby support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel color alone does not say how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

after sett@@ ling on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to th@@ urs@@ day morning in the F@@ öhn@@ valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ country partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday a fo@@ eh@@ n for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here the rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be calculated in the south of the Alps , after having already fallen in large rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow goes off the air , as a result a cold front is rolling with powerful , partly wit@@ tr@@ led rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind blows up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north @-@ east with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south , on the weekend it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Prize
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday at the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in sec@@ rec@@ y over the centuries .
with the pla@@ za , it is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he then emp@@ tied the city as a ruined sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions might have encouraged him , according to historians , in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on aband@@ on@@ ment .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who expressed his very personal interpretations of Bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for around three years , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
cycles that focus on topics like cross @-@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ es are created .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with his theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into contemporary contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original text of the Bible by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to give twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant rule of the dominion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to be able to re@@ pay me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to give art more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , let them look at them , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he gras@@ ps life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that are important to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en your life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn approaches
plans were made , the company was commissioned to model the earth &apos;s hills for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ bahn it was finished again .
there were failures in politics and administration , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill scre@@ ened , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first vice @-@ president Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the sli@@ pper@@ y situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in addressing upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs have to face politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German So@@ ccer League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear signal if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football federal states , no , we must use our beam power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European qualifying match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the federal government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have been called up for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses eye when accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost bled , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once again , if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except Battle ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely broken .
the National@@ spieler will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen again on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his trunk eleven on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change at the door @-@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller took the place of gene@@ alogy novel brushes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether wil@@ der f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les allowed him to be open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner statement by Mit@@ aka R@@ eus , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , means that mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl proves to be understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety while ensuring less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick shift to digital radio .
a test track is currently being produced on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be br@@ ushed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , road@@ worth@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany by 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D MEP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the Germans are still looking scep@@ tical about self @-@ driving cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years with it , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 per cent of the traffic in the flowing traffic could be seen on the free@@ way , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at Table @-@ EM
according to the current status of Düsseldorf , the Düsseldorf plans to open only in singles , from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European training course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term term for sponsorship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had missed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth World Champion fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has pulled a serious injury to the right leg .
in the Champions League play at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the def@@ enders were met with a tac@@ kling of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was indicated by Bas@@ tian Sch@@ wit@@ t &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player .
terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cab@@ aret : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak in the past , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen from 18th September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial posture to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was done : to figure out the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material have incar@@ n@@ ated to Munich .
just before the start of the Oc@@ tober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the dis@@ car@@ ding of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry lace as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in a large quantity for customers , who , for example , processed them to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en gran@@ ary .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace fashion plays a major role , was then pushed aside by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styles is an increasing order potential .
anyone who has no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they make up half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien industry association .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are almost no private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold through chains .
it also weak@@ ens exports , current to Russia and the US .
there are plenty of reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery factory in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
architect U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies , which must first of all think economic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball tip .

the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything before with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en Top - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

XI push@@ es to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open itself more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned to steer the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal state @-@ owned business environment and makes the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organisation Food@@ watch , which has received a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explains Matthias Wolfs@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ette for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , some 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to Food@@ S@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low , that they are already keeping the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal , highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is strongly enriched over the food chain , above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low quantities , particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written report from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet the Green Bundestag , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
