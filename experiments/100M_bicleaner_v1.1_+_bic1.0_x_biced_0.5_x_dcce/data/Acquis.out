a ) This agreement occurs for non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are completed for entry into force of this Convention ;
II ) If the Community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures concerning this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other upon request of one of the parties concerned about a change in this convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all member states of the organization from any change in this convention .
a ) This agreement enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and States receives the written Noti@@ fication that their procedures are completed for entry into force .
B ) This Agreement shall remain in force for as long as the States Parties shall be the Parties of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to determine the procedures to be applied during the implementation of the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of the tur@@ no@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear programs for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a tur@@ no@@ ff by risk early detection .
in order to obtain the target stated in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance , the material quantity which has not been proven for a certain period is specified with speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear We@@ ap@@ ons in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
when applying its security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following type and , as far as necessary , see how they are specified in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , offset , lost or otherwise removed core material and the quantities removed from the stock ;
B ) evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a log and reporting system that displays the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) measures to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures following this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) An early or th@@ orium material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or process phase in which it is produced or is imported into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards stipul@@ ated in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not sub@@ du@@ ed , the community is not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues in Article 11 , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) the core material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities under Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
upon request of the community , the organisation &apos;s core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , exemp@@ ts from these safegu@@ ards as long as the whole material quantity liberated in the states is no longer at any point in time than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium enrich@@ ing more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the community meets the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the Organisation after this Convention , in particular to determine how the procedures set out in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ in between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 of the initial report , the organisation will carry out a summary of the core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be tied within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this Agreement and the Central B@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table from which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special ac@@ tional account , &quot; which consists of the funds that Member States contribute to the special transaction ; this account is used by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and according to the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ solvency deb@@ its of the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the state in order to be the administrator of the special ac@@ tional account and to deposit at the place of charge of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the ste@@ ward agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at another date , which was agreed upon between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach member state may wish to make payments prior to the aforementioned dates on request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker performs approximately proportional dra@@ fts on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special action loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and predictable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special action loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ payable development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply for the funds financed by the organization of funds financed by the organization .
the means of the special ac@@ tional account must not be used instead of reasonable funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special action loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; consequently , they are re@@ payable in ten years each in 50 years .
special action loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
every special action loan is governed by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means is given .
the revenues from any special action loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to the stipul@@ ations stipul@@ ated by the car@@ et@@ aker at the time of the loan granted , may be recipients of a special loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC to the complete allocation of all special action loans to the E@@ EC on the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the time of re@@ payment of the special action loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special action loan and the expenses incurred for this .
the Administrator obli@@ ges the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account completion .
after full payment of the special action loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special ac@@ tional account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date by the E@@ EC and the Organisation if necessary , the agreement and all the ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total capital amount paid by all recipients accepted by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States rati@@ fy the decision of the proceedings concerned by the Council of the European Communities .
the Secretary @-@ General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper permit of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is contained in two scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
considering that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol no . 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT en@@ acted the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are to be transferred to a common company under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research projects , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable every contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by amal@@ gam@@ ating their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for mutual research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to achieve faster .
to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties will associate their respective research programmes in Anne@@ x I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom Programme and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme under@@ takes the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or modified by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association stated in paragraph 1 is realised through : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- The exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
in the context of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project .
in terms of the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties are called an association agreement , which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ate organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated institutions , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common company J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become contractual partner of any treaty , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the organs , mand@@ ated with carrying out the association designated in Article 2 , 1 of the present Agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement shall , in particular , be obliged to set up a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to ensure that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group set up within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to guarantee the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities to which this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated bodies and aims at the joint aim of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the common objective defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world are taken into consideration .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG identifies one or more Swiss representatives in the counselling groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities ask for it .
the counselling groups , which make the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task in terms of all research and development work referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
the committee of directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and that is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the programme , will lead to this task in respect of all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordin@@ ating committees , which are subject to the Committee of Directors , submit suitable proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , which fall under the present agreement in respect to all research and development work .
the BA@@ F includes a representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country responsible for core and energy research .
on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programmes and the determination of its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of merger .
the statements made by the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of Directors , the Advisory Committee , and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character .
the statement of the VG for the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties work on the work of all technical @-@ advisory bodies or of all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme according to this agreement is annually fixed to an amount equal to that of Eur@@ atom &apos;s disputed proportion of the cost of Eur@@ atom programmes in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as this is established .
in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects an amount to the Common company J@@ ET , which is to be determined according to the provisions of the statutes of this common company .
the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year is fores@@ een . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Council pays the commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the other payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in Anne@@ x III of the present agreement .
Switzerland takes all necessary measures to enable Eur@@ atom of customs or other duties and import restrictions and restrictions to be exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom that are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement .
objects acquired or acquired there may not be reimbur@@ sed in this country , nor free of charge , unless otherwise approved by the Federal Council .
these exemp@@ tions are not applicable to hi@@ ber@@ men and dec@@ eased , who are paid to these persons .

the provisions on access to the knowledge required for the participation of Switzerland on the Common Market of J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Common Market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of every contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
- the exchange of personnel under the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ;
- appropriate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible use of the amounts used .
the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and the associated organs in works in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics will be conducted by Switzerland and individuals or companies that justify access to these knowledge under the same conditions as Member States , individuals or companies of Eur@@ atom .
the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the Associ@@ ated Third Parties , as well as to individuals or companies that conduct research or production activities in a member state of Eur@@ atom or an associated third state , which justify access to these knowledge .
the parties share this knowledge to other states , individuals or companies only if a treaty is concluded between the parties unless these individuals or companies engage in research or production activities that justify the access to these knowledge .
if the knowledge applied under section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies based in the countries concerned for research purposes in pursuit of the objectives of this agreement .
the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third states and the persons or companies resident in the concerned countries may be granted licenses or licenses to use these patents for industrial or commercial purposes , as far as the parties are authorised to grant such licenses or sub@@ licenses .
the knowledge gained from the activities of Eur@@ atom , associated organs and Switzerland prior to the entry into force of this agreement will be made accessible to the states , persons or companies that may be communicated in paragraph 1 and 2 , as far as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge indicated in these figures .
patents granted from the activities specified in this section will be provided to the States , individuals or companies that may obtain a license or sub@@ license to the patents stated in paragraph 3 of this article , as far as this is required for the use of these licenses or sub @-@ licenses .

the parties are ch@@ aired by the parties , altern@@ ately on the basis of the Trade Rules of the Joint Committee of Eur@@ atom / Switzerland .
the fusion surplus Eur@@ atom / Switzerland occurs at the request of one of the contracting parties , at least once a year .
disputes relating to the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal on request of one of the two parties .
the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal referred to in paragraph 1 of this article will be made case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
each party ap@@ points a member , and these two members appoint a third member to assume the chair@@ manship of the arbit@@ ration court .
every contracting party bears the costs of its own member in the arbit@@ ration process ; the costs of the previous seat and the remaining costs are borne to equal parts of both parties .
it enters into force when the parties have communicated to each other that the procedure required for this purpose has been carried out .
this agreement is concluded for the duration of the Eur@@ atom program mentioned in Article 1 ; it is sil@@ ently extended in accordance with other relevant programme decisions of Eur@@ atom .
if such a further program commen@@ ces , the extension for the duration of the new program , which occurs in the place of the Eur@@ atom programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I , is considered not to be terminated if it only comes to delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom program .
before any decision on the acceptance of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the parties are consul@@ ted within the scope of the items mentioned in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a six month notice .
in the form of a letter change to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for the adjustment of customs tari@@ ff terms in the case of renewed changes in tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further to add an article 12 to the agreement .
I am honored to confirm the consent of the community to these changes and propose you the date for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the standing .
I am honored to confirm the receipt of your present writing with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent to the standing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of member states within the medium @-@ term financial state
the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit tab@@ s with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion bills ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below for which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
in every stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially take up an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without having exceeded a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for the possible extension , the B@@ IS would calculate a loan opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings will not be made prior to the end of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draws would take place in the B@@ IS at the time of the agreement at the available currencies , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking account of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who use the B@@ IS at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the BI@@ Z , however , must obtain the required funds itself on the market , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the corresponding margin increased by the margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit tab@@ s with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day when the last of the parties has left their acceptance certificate to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) however , after the exp@@ iry of two years , this additional protocol enters into force upon which it has been suspended , unless one of the parties has notified an objection to his entry into force .
from that point on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the party party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , to all States and the European Economic Community any assumption or objection in the sense of Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , Noti@@ fication or Communication in connection with this Convention .
whereas in the case of need in the spirit of European solidarity , the Member States should support one another in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents .
whereas mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are submitted jointly by the Member States and the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions for their import are granted -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin to determine blood groups and to identify blood intoler@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every contracting party may limit the application of this agreement on re@@ agents of human origin to the identification of blood groups by a declaration addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe by an explanation aimed at the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be recalled at any time by an Noti@@ fication addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the Parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for the determination of the cost of their extraction , preparation and promotion , and , if necessary , the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are urgently needed , if they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group identification are provided to other parties only under the condition that it is not associated with any profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and provided only to places designated by the governments involved .

a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum fer@@ til@@ isation in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of blood cell in@@ filtration in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , activity is expressed by the time required for an ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as all anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group definition , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being developed .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ stal@@ em@@ ate , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard prepar@@ ate or a state standard preparation in International units ( See Bulletin who O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B bul@@ b contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards at the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ent form , according to the label , lies at most one year after the last satisfactory test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is sealed in such a way that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with dry re@@ agents ) may be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent is still fu@@ ell@@ eting the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human Orig@@ in for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in flu@@ ent form or after recovery , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents intended for international exchange for blood group identification should not be colored artificial as possible , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group identification can be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents assigned must be stored for such a long time from the laboratory , until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black on white printed label can be fixed in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , quantity and composition of the liquid needed to restore
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the use instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements to the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly be changed if international standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
