<seg id="697">In order to obtain the target stated in Article 28, the material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the investigations carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation, in which for each material balance, the material quantity which has not been proven for a certain period is specified with specifying the accuracy limits for the specified amounts.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their investigations, the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Weapons in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>

<seg id="723">C) Twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this agreement, precautions for the reuse of the securing measures are taken on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets the organisation of supplementary agreements, which are in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the Organisation after this Convention, in particular to determine how the procedures set out in the Convention are to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without altering the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force. the organisation, the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the take-in between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 of the initial report, the organisation will carry out a summary of the core material in the States, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be tied within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this Agreement and the Central Bindings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has submitted a table from which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special actional account," which consists of the funds that Member States contribute to the special transaction; this account is used by the organization as a steward and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and according to the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or insolvency debits of the member state, which must be paid upon request in the currency of the state in order to be the administrator of the special actional account and to deposit at the place of charge of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the steward agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1. January 1979 or at another date, which was agreed upon between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each member state may wish to make payments prior to the aforementioned dates on request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker performs approximately proportional drafts on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special action loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans the caretaker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and predictable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special action loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly repayable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it is a loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that apply for the funds financed by the organization of funds financed by the organization.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the special actional account must not be used instead of reasonable funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special action loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; consequently, they are repayable in ten years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special action loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Every special action loan is governed by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the means is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenues from any special action loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which, according to the stipulations stipulated by the caretaker at the time of the loan granted, may be recipients of a special loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC to the complete allocation of all special action loans to the EEC on the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of repayment of the special action loan, the caretaker teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special action loan and the expenses incurred for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator obliges the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditor of the organization to this account completion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special action loan, the administrator of the EEC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special actional account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">"" "" "" "the EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the state of the special interaction account, the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date by the EEC and the Organisation if necessary, the agreement and all the ensuing obligations of the parties are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount paid by all recipients accepted by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the ensuing obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
