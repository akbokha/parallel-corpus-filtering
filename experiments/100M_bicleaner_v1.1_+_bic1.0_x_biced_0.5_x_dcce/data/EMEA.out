this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ural Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l Thin@@ king and Spe@@ aking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , a mental disorder where the patients have man@@ ic Ep@@ iso@@ des ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for inser@@ ting or melting tablets can be used in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients taking other medicines at the same time , which are also de@@ composed just like Abi@@ li@@ fy , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s dose should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole is thought to be a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but is less effective than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing brain activity , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ oper@@ ati@@ i@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by increased un@@ rest associated with lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for inser@@ ting .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms in four of the five short @-@ term studies more effectively than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , tre@@ mor , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in whom the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , vis @-@ à @-@ vis the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in people with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. to appro@@ ve Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s placing across the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ anna pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a 15 mg / day maintenance dose , regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration for the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consider to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effects of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dos@@ ages of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ an concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ op@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ op@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia were observed in patients treated with semi @-@ oper@@ atic ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ than@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ surgery .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS uncovered 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or estimated acute over@@ doses of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ Pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a semi @-@ operated study , in week 52 , the percentage of respon@@ dents adher@@ ing to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ h depression schedule , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi @-@ oper@@ atic .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ apse rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ dite @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing male symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies study over 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mono@@ therapies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ atic in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ atic .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly did not respond to li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the el@@ ong@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ graphy of Ari@@ pi@@ Pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l for extensively metabol@@ ised metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific clinical @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the one to three times the average daily dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l did not show more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after do@@ zing , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ dite @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies study over 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to placebo no superior efficacy .
the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) was compared in a relative bio availability study in which the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with healthy subjects .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the one to three times the average daily dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after do@@ zing , which resulted in ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in people with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ id muscle or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by envel@@ oping adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ Pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes caused by bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally used in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the dose of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and who at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dos@@ ages of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dosage height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
when 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ ot@@ ment of Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS uncovered 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of ag@@ gi@@ tis / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders coupled with placebo and was similar to semi @-@ oper@@ atic .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in terms of ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ami reference arm .
the average improvement of the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.@@ 8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ Pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a semi @-@ oper@@ atic controlled study , in week 52 , the percentage of respon@@ dents adher@@ ing to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % .
current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi @-@ oper@@ atic .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ dite @-@ controlled multi @-@ blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly did not respond to li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the suppor@@ tive therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ ma@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority compared to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional ari@@ th@@ me@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ ot@@ ment or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
only patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time were considered to have no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before starting treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that in patients the first treatment is no longer more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited company to permit the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , treatment can be interrupted until improvements are achieved on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose @-@ adjusting in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be stopped and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in the case of patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in the event of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tious methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and after 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised to not produce a child for up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm count before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the transport and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects , which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed below are the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ase hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , hur@@ t@@ ful g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , chest pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
the frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive link in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence were possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the merging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ se@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ escence receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) for pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved in@@ fusion studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ cation for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity over pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to finish bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
active exposure level ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to IV 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data is available about patients aged over 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be respected when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow valve .
after adding the solution , the tap water should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid material .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the S@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if an own blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with S@@ se@@ amed must be taken under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ et@@ aker , provided that they have received an appropriate instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and for patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference physician .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks before receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o prior to either stre@@ amed or continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of stre@@ amed ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine headaches and confusion .
par@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union regulations , a proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger surgical interventions that demand a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce foreign blood before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in one patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the sustained ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia and follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase is increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation count of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rec@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ therapy is unlikely and treatment should be cancelled .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
the iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large amounts of iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively present 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of operation and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection may be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients suffering from some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the report should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ o communication , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the rec@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be examined for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ corpor@@ eal induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributable to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ine when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should consider a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should be investigated and treated accordingly before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , especially in underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hi@@ mo@@ an value of &gt; 13 g / dl may be an increased risk of post @-@ post thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the growing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
from in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
through thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , neur@@ ys@@ m , ret@@ inal@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa were reported .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ary events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients receiving ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
irrespective of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lic@@ ated and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrates with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

in 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 m@@ amma cancer , 260 lung cancer , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ a .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to several common malign@@ omas consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
oste@@ opathic pul@@ mon@@ ary fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experiments with nearly the 20@@ x of the week dose recommended to use at humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished f@@ ede@@ ma body weight , to a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are however of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the market has to supply the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Intro@@ duction of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts .
the owner of the in@@ verter has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the marketing application is operational before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug used in the traffic is used .
the owner of the risk management plan specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as described in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , is agreed upon in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) adopted in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP should also be submitted : • when receiving new information which may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction concerned ) mil@@ estones
• If you have suffered a heart attack or stroke within one month of your treatment , if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of coron@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) , for example , if you have already performed such a coron@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis .
you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion disease ) , the cervical canal ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a moderate dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is reg@@ ressed again for further treatment .
your doctor will need regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , breakdown of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ ia , it will break down your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , the se@@ amed @-@ amed injection has to be given in a V@@ ene ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or asc@@ ending potassium levels , your doctor may consider a dis@@ continuation of the treatment with the second amed , until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically revealed coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the latest findings , the treatment of coron@@ ary ar@@ tery with diabetes in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past have already occurred thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that the stre@@ amed effect works like a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is about to happen , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before treatment starts and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get rid amed , as there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of suppression of the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your physician will need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may also order regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
as soon as you are well prepared , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may also order regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after the operation .
however , if your doctor considers this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash ab@@ se@@ amed yourself beneath the skin .

eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat , and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a coron@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with S@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery ( post @-@ post thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial hi@@ mo@@ th@@ ole value is too high

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered from a lower trau@@ matic hip as in H@@ inf@@ ra ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by inj@@ ections into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate as@@ cla@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood was norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients with A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of the patients below A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients taking placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other constitu@@ ents .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw@@ s .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • Pre@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Requi@@ rements of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking at medical or nursing care
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after the application of ap@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with a kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy is missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia may develop , whose maximum typically occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available for patients who require dental intervention , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administ@@ ering A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen briefly after the application of ap@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the preval@@ ence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders , which have been associated as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance ( measured yearly prior to administration ) and the onset of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were compared in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cla@@ im@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of therapy was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Pa@@ get trials ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administ@@ ering A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the in@@ fusion center , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area was covered mainly in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis in the jaw area at one with A@@ cla@@ sta and patients treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , the dose of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compensated .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ ho@@ e ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equal lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar fo@@ lic acid , hip and dist@@ al radi@@ us compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip around 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the basin comb after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in comparison to placebo an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volumes and the retention of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose was significantly reduced by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % to the overall pen@@ al and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % with A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.5 @-@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control in comparison to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( referred to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up period .
of the 143 patients with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid lasting from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large circulation cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of half a ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
the early distribution stages ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values mentioned above ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearing amounts regardless of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a mild ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min . no dose @-@ adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
because there are only limited data for serious kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C , 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered ; in dogs a 15@@ - minute in@@ fusion was administered 0,@@ 25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels .

risk Management Plan The owner of the licensing agreement is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance carried out in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorization application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive on risk management systems for human pharmaceutical products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is dissemin@@ ated , which could influence the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk in@@ im@@ itation ) was reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
in Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction is too fast and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have plenty of liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip replacement .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
because A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completion of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering ending treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please follow your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
at present , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have such symptoms in yourself after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

prolonged pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported to patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of ap@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ei@@ emia may develop , whose maximum typically occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ap@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you require further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia suffers from a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and furthermore one or more
in addition , there were four studies involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , studies on smoking cess@@ ation showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to estimate in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? er The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia reported during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised at the same time using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HI@@ V@@ - Inf@@ ection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight patients
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the AR@@ Z

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur .
relatives or other close relatives ) are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s Wort ( St. John &apos;s Wort ) is believed to indicate that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
patients with overweight subjects as well as patients with obesity have studied , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated for weight loss and due to accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant when the incidence was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ;
only slight symptoms were observed in a study of a study in which a limited number of persons were given disposable en@@ cores of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
weight reduction after one year amounted to 20 mg for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.@@ 6@@ kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with

in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo I
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in the mid @-@ weight change between the 20 mice and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % determined by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and accounted for about 50 % by weight loss .
2 hours achieved , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin color can have a up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18 - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but observed in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given for a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not indicate changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ural Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be adequately adjusted in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ y@@ lic res@@ p or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was evaluated in triple therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were used .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of acet@@ oni@@ de for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high cor@@ p levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in the form of mon@@ otherapy , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited authorization for Ac@@ tos &apos; placing in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the application of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients aged under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output h@@ ep@@ atic cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch@@ iness , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one continues , should be guided by the clinical assessment until the outcome of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be accumulated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution following treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is the result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as or@@ ally dou@@ ble@@ - or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but adequate physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one
the expected frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or that occurs , the treatment is to be treated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etus growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not appreciated from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of refra@@ ction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials involving pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents often appear to be less than placebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or .
since the market launch has been rarely reported about heart failure among pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , more often when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparable medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ sty as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the treatment a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials for one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly higher L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , while measured values were observed in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the gro@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both over an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular diseases .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in plasma normally 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination period of unchanged pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 to 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance resemble themselves .
in toxic@@ ological studies , plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy was observed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and decreases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etus growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expected frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the gro@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both over an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study found the objective of their primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one .

ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane traffic across the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is enhanced by intensified insulin therapy , for example , can significantly change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , insulin type ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore needs to consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always after other medications taken by them .
4 As hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ esis , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

skin diseases and skin connec@@ tive tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site can cause a eyel@@ ash ro@@ phy , if failed to change the inj@@ ections inside the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the administration site Gel@@ eg@@ rine - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the actual maximum is achieved within 2 to 8 hours , and the entire active duration amounts up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid resp@@ . delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split are active .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin acting rapidly must first be absorbed , then the amount of long acting insulin .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that an intraven@@ ous prescribed ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium deposits which may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur , so it is recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had transplan@@ tation because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , where 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg of urine acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients with placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , rash and abnormal liver ) .
in particular , in patients with heart problems in the pre @-@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also contain a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia associated with diseases that have already resulted in ur@@ anium deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available by rheum@@ atism and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .

liver diseases Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical studies , slight conspic@@ u@@ ities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and , depending on the clinical findings , ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ist did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .

in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be related to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experiments do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
in the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg treated .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the statements occasionally .

clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ ac@@ acid levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum for study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.2 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering of serum acid level to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in the open extension study of phase 3 demonstrated in two years that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment for a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ alle@@ ti@@ um , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the top no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Valu@@ es ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage of serum acid concentration were observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its well known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair could be found as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .

these findings are seen as a consequence of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

in the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ ac@@ acid levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
the data gathered in the open extension study of phase 3 demonstrated in two years that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment for a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a g@@ out ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bone is br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as oxygen b@@ ump@@ ing .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be used in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following information is to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
for example , pep@@ tic ul@@ cer@@ us , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , must be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , hor@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point out possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain , or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who don &apos;t take the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the planning of therapy in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should likewise be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dra &apos;s clinical trials were taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums received up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / l &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the average BM@@ D asc@@ ents with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur han@@ ger and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.3 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption of an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily disper@@ sed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance had ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys via the kidneys or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before taking a meal the middle area was below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 mirrors ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is quickly hydro@@ xi@@ ated to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 in the liver and then metabol@@ ised in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
elimination With the addition of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy volunteers , the medi@@ an ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , in the f@@ eces after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there are no clinical data available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , as in animal testing , will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
therefore , in patients with limited ren@@ al function , increased levels of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t was necessary or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension , hyper@@ tension , and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dose ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
Adv@@ ant@@ ine dosage ought to be based primarily on clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us bottom mirrors should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the agra@@ f @-@ dose @-@ chemical can take several days until Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral intake of medicines in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for creating an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For suppression of the transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Pre@@ vention of Gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ine therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ine therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this change@@ over has to occur in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral starting dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplan@@ t for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dosage of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients - although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph in lung , p@@ ank@@ ful and intest@@ ine @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in diabe@@ tic transplan@@ t patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with limited ren@@ al function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ates and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f In the transition from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a low @-@ clearance drug , adap@@ tations of the dose may take several days until Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the tal@@ low in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 to 20 ng / ml and at 10 to 20 ng / ml of transplan@@ t and heart transplan@@ t patients .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or excess @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and daily dose ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the sec@@ ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies is to be avoided during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy identified as a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , which can therefore occur under adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are symptoms of PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose , are especially advised .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal transit .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures can be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the con@@ current treatment with a large number of other drugs .
the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data not invaluable ) .

ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are expected to acquire the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell inn@@ s .
this results in a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ id genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent of T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recept@@ ors .

the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Gra@@ ft 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was significantly lower .
a multi @-@ centric study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation , which were treated by a random@@ ized trial tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplan@@ tation demonstrated an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via bile .
in stable patients who were switched from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of VI@@ II factor .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
advance is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new ble@@ ed@@ ings with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ant may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the import of lawyers across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not sink below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cross@@ bars is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis The long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose , a test must be carried out to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration is to follow after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there is no experience of using Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
AD@@ R@@ s , which occurred in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in plasma and the clearance rate again showed adequate values on the 15th day of the postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate H@@ ast@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
moreover , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial constituted 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a continuing peak of the antibody @-@ mirror against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product specifications as part of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the advancement of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a type of virus genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and cannot cause infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advance could have directly inj@@ ected into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ generate normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of under@@ growth , in bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions presented to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP issued a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not adequately proven that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficiently that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and up , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % reduction in symptoms compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients who suffer from an an@@ es@@ op@@ r@@ ha@@ gic effect ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to appro@@ ve the transfer of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application may decrease the activity of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ ti@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ tiva , which can be performed per@@ ally or nas@@ al ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with a kidney or liver function disorder and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening the headache ) must be reli@@ eved .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
however , in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric tests revealed no significant differences between the patients treated with the patients and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not they were taken with alcohol alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of a@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impaired mobility or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ itated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ mental pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dro@@ ught , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma .
after the oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n had bad metabolism .
a component interaction study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent after the sole injection of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine &apos;s bio@@ equivalent was to exposure after gift of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer identify any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the marketing application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , can develop its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes with con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the gin@@ gi@@ val drug Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this drug .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ si@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the pul@@ mon@@ ary mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches .
if you are using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken medicine , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medicine .
when used in recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or al@@ loc@@ ates attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze when you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the given time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart ch@@ ases , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves ) or skin rash are reported .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of eye @-@ catching liver attacks were also very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion .
for children aged one to five , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by investigating the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to authori@@ ze the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy of the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the clinical course of the disease and may be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed during their recur@@ rence .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be advised that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impaired mobility or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with a lost lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were given .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of total scores for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was also studied for other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine replacement is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n may also improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with chlor@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ xing significantly , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general , seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation , once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded
in @-@ vi@@ vo , DES@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer identify any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher exposure strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normal .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall preval@@ ence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines received a daily dose of IO@@ P of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which a daily dose of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was used for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor disability .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol @-@ induced increase in alcohol depen@@ ded on increasing drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of total scores for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ern ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which may be impaired .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the lau@@ com@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

there is limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy of the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall preval@@ ence of the side effects between the lost lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate to the recipient &apos;s formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no effect on standard measurement parameters including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black people ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normal .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall preval@@ ence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
infants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , one single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s placing on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges , which can easily be spread by humans to humans because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form an antibody in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , am@@ ate@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
am@@ ate@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor checked the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs twice a day .
in children between four and 12 years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of am@@ ate@@ ase is directed after body weight .
in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , am@@ ate@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS cannot cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had viral load below 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , as@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few people responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gen@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had a greater decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drugs that are also degra@@ ded as well as am@@ ate@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take as@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
am@@ ate@@ ase is usually taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee found that the benefits of am@@ ate@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were not proven in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company to permit the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually , am@@ pren@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic packs of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ational capsules and solution for admission on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for am@@ ate@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ chie avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ ate@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ ger@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ ate@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ ate@@ ase capsules in adult patients with a medi@@ oc@@ cured liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders 300 mg twice a day .
simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and , moreover , represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ ate@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ ate@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver ab@@ norm@@ alities with potentially fatal disease .
for the case of con@@ current anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ei@@ v@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active ingredient concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ lic content of the A@@ gener@@ ase Solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be set off in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to serious clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV / AIDS and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with pharmaceuticals whose active agents are metabol@@ ised predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects were observed on the liver .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , by contrast , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % decrease when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was conducted to use as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase differ for at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not necessary in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may decrease serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ pi@@ ps .
if these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ ate@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions when used together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is recommended that ant@@ acids do not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase because it can cause resor@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous use of am@@ ate@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels at the same time administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ initi@@ s poly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the present administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while caution is advised with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while using as@@ gener@@ ase .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plas@@ m@@ hole of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fa@@ der .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Auto@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ able , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time using am@@ ate@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk @-@ lac@@ ing rats but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early on and rarely led to treatment termination .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of as@@ gener@@ a or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , and were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 NR@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be stopped with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who were observed under all@@ ot@@ ase treatment . exceptions were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were observed very frequently in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indic@@ ative of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ y poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ stages with the result of an education in@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in cases of chron@@ ically infected cells .
the correlation between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance test@@ ings can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance test@@ ings can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there is currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral antibodies that failed to cause an Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of which demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which U@@ PI treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI@@ s were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ mit@@ ability of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average variation of the bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ vacuum threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 of which were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximal serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume and an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of unused am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents varies depending on the total dose concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of am@@ ate@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ as lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained at healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanisms for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ genic aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas were not clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has yet been observed in clinical studies , either during the administration of am@@ ate@@ ase or after the end of treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the control and the animals treated with the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma @-@ exposure significantly higher ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us g@@ ong@@ ation and minor changes in skel@@ etal changes , which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ chie avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ ate@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ ger@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with low or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active ingredient concentration .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug addic@@ ts , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ ro@@ co@@ lic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , by contrast , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ iz@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by means of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Auto@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dra ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
during the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is indic@@ ative of signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents varies depending on the total dose concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

studies on the toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the control and the animals treated with the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ ile the met@@ abo@@ lization methods are still not fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ ger@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been proven either with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ational capsules and solution for admission on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ger@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution to use and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose @-@ adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of ast@@ er@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ lic content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that am@@ ate@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ ate@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of sending HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active ingredient concentration .
am@@ ate@@ ase should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ ro@@ co@@ lic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , by contrast , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , a significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk @-@ lac@@ ing rats but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of as@@ gener@@ a or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r inhibit@@ ors .
the early departure of a nar@@ rowing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be locked into the tissue by a large Vet@@ ei@@ form volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and administered Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
• In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should continue until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ um area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient will be able to apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and must be cleared in the clean@@ sed , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a risk in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision have been observed .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has yet been found for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous ad@@ min@@ ants for the treatment of external fac@@ ul@@ ties in the genital and peri@@ stal@@ sis area .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient population .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months are available after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs have no clinical experience , so the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial indicate that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip .
very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis at anatom@@ ic sites outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of treatment intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions cause a large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial reveal that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - lesi@@ ons showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although there is no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) after one @-@ off topical application , no recommendation can be given during lac@@ tation .
the most frequently shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream relating to side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ al patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , were in these studies a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects identified by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were listed below .
the clinical signs shown according to the study plan show that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it was common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ ch@@ ori@@ ation / fla@@ x / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the assessment of clinical signs indicated according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream showed severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could result in nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in the treatment of genital war@@ ts in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od overall , the genital war@@ ts healed completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study of four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated were clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external ti@@ lt , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed with three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable p@@ ouch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application was low on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; another study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months did not show similar effects for the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small systemic absorption out of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used in patients with a proven diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by investigating its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over 5 years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to authori@@ ze the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mammals cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated in patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only occur in an appropriate clinical setting , where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding response has occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experiments do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to mother &apos;s milk in relation to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , it is recommended to not feed with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms that were observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions were observed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form of follow @-@ up and a duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of serum in patients aged less than 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or to early retirement from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with whom it never came to serum .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels had a robust decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which seemed to not imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme substitution therapy lies in a recovery of enzyme activity in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken from cells to the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that had the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of the patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement of the lung function and the ability to go , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V over this period is not clin@@ ically significant and the total lung volume increases propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into consideration by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes consisted of five efficacy variables ( expected to be expected ) in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year , open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . younger patients with a severe form of tra@@ verse ( &lt; 2.5 years ) showed normal mental development speed , whereas older patients with severe form of course were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ as were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ as is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution is under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the specified time , the owner of the in@@ verter has concluded the following study program , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this tab will hold long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ is@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for creating an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , will gradually increase at a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
however , in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint Diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • ery@@ thro@@ sis • Incre@@ ased pulse • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution is under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( by means of as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of th@@ inning cylinders to be th@@ inn@@ ed after body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) cancer has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not yet been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given .
in patients whose blood picture changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin experienced an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months for doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times when administ@@ ering A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .
each nozzle must be dis@@ sol@@ dered with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the tap water and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for large @-@ scale epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with small chor@@ o@@ idal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours , approximately 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Gift and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first fixed dose and after each third movement cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a full blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ check must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
following the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient receives the value prior to treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials do not indicate that in patients with 65 years of age or above , there is an increased risk of side effects when compared to patients aged 65 and older .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were necessary , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not examined specifically in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with respect to bone and immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ logy number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis cycles again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated if pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred were risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , preval@@ ent hyper@@ tension , or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accum@@ ulations in the trans@@ ell@@ ular region , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment is to be considered .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible edi@@ fication of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment inn to obtain advice on the conservation of sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy required increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Auto@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
no data is available for use in pregnant women , but as for any an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
fixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except when demanding and after careful balancing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning to obtain advice on the sper@@ mat@@ ological service .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 mixed mono @-@ therapy trials ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % vs 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values for liver function tests .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding ) , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment , occasionally fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial Pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
there were reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its action by disrup@@ ting important , fol@@ ate metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ mis syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients treated only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) related to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) in the use of the Lun@@ - gen@@ om@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and an in@@ timi@@ dation of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment due to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ mit@@ ability of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

the analysis of the impact of the hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Contin@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inferior , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ inferior boundary of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin require fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
furthermore , the patients required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.4 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as a mono@@ therapeutic were investigated in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
fixed dose is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found unchanged within 24 hours following the application in the urine .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total concentration of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

dissolve the contents of the 100@@ mg plastic flas@@ ks with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of mixed mixed .
dissolve the contents of 500 mg plastic bottles with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of mixed mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients taking All@@ i and taking no weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they cannot drain some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats taken with the food un@@ bark@@ ing the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stains on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , stool , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , discharge o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which non @-@ sufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company to appro@@ ve or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fat @-@ based diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as or@@ list@@ at is only absorbed minim@@ ally , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant precau@@ tions in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption observed in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , before bed@@ time a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement should be taken to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of one single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal properties and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal adverse events were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
the incidence of reported side @-@ effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days in normal weigh@@ ty and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , any systemic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ siv@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fatty acid diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight during the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg - 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ on@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , namely M1 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data will not be able to identify any particular danger to humans .

if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat rich main court or a substantial Nach@@ tisch@@ - as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not apply drugs to children after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ agel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it in any case . • You can use your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) with this pack .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ eal cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
for the amount of calories you can use , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Du@@ e to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight by gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you daily burn down stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you exercise 150 k@@ cal per day , for example 3 km of walking , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and also to observe them . • Imag@@ ine is a food diary with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fat @-@ du@@ ously and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and reach your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies that are powerful triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of al@@ oh@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are powerful triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ o showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ o showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients receiving on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ oh@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ mon@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
except in connection with another chemotherapy administration , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics studied against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cy@@ c@@ ine@@ tic Clear@@ ance .
experience on the use of pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ oh@@ m over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250@@ mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , and 250 or 750 mc@@ g of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate , and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous cy@@ tom@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations following a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that the total composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination following an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous in@@ jek@@ tion in healthy patients the total body serum was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function distur@@ b the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggesting a low relevance for clinical use .
10 . prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ at@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the action of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose accounted for about 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) that were given daily for two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the marketing authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) which stimulates it to form the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s manufacturer presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference physician .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the CH@@ MP to reject permission for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns have been raised that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to market cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ar@@ ded again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from that , the study used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to determine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infection .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo discussed treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body &apos;s tissue ) or from infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for the transport of al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy may be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ ti@@ sing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after 2 @-@ 3 days treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ ot@@ in@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on the sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fo@@ etus / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the use of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the treatment with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was the administration location which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line im@@ pe@@ des the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units .
if , due to the local preval@@ ence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms seems question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and isolated skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism@@ in ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in a maximum estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats were detected in oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ ization , and it is ensured that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan , consisting of two doses , can be brought to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can resist a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ inated Twin@@ rix A@@ du@@ p , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ines approved since 1997 - Twin@@ rix .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix ul@@ ts were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 doses of vaccine ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a licence for placing Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the immun@@ ization plan for the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection vaccine is desired for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated with appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent people who responded to a Hepatitis A@@ vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is achieved , so that additional doses can be required in these cases .
since intra@@ stro@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ eller success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix in the second year in form of a separate injection was administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that there is no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ eness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines aged between 1 and 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy on a calculation base per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of matching was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to the one observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units with form @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units formally in@@ activated Hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies conducted at vacc@@ ines between 1 and 15 years of age , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was invaluable were the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of immun@@ ization , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formally in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination scheme , compared to the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the intake of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present wor@@ ding in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and serum levels similar to previous wor@@ ding for the current formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ code on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus , even though the complete series of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis C or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , ambient pressure is applied to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child is subjected to a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 tell your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / her child has been vacc@@ inated recently , or if you / her child has been vacc@@ inated or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / or has been planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not given , unless it is urgently needed for vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ extrem@@ ly ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the inser@@ ting or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • Appeti@@ zing appetite

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have become known since the first approval of the in@@ verter , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only marketed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered by a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Ammon@@ ia may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems , or taste in@@ version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; given only limited information on this medicine at the time of admission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake required for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing problems as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased neur@@ ons loss .
there was also a delayed stimulation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ low , and the disease itself was leading to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with the nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidney , including phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat at so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
following an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measurement of measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was determined 15 minutes after intake .
in the majority of patients with circul@@ atory disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rats ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) were det@@ ectable in the following morning after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma percentage were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine product .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us &apos;s results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate did not have a compla@@ ined effect in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
following an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined 15 minutes after the intake .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products which accumulate after eating proteins in the body .
if you are going to carry out laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken medicine , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , aband@@ on@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory defic@@ its and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , such as unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox during all@@ ot@@ ment or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remained in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or a year in order to prevent new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox in reference to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other Hir@@ u@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to authori@@ ze the transport of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous 0.1 mg / kg in@@ fusion , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately prior to the procedure a stu@@ b of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ ot@@ ting bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the dose dose may be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney dysfunction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT again to check the ACT 5 minutes after the second stu@@ n dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ inal Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated le@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Sever@@ e hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible hem@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in PCI patients suffer from arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may undergo bleeding all over the course of the treatment .
in patients taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a monitoring of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is once again reached the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly .
the animal experiments are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events compared to male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dated and GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma or bleeding in the point range , with a reduction of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood li@@ gi@@ cal@@ isations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tures , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events compared to male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes listed in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately to be stopped and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on the cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turns the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , whereby the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reactions .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot effectively handle insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with Type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p was noted after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin molecule or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis German GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change in the amount of insulin , the brand &apos;s ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin requirement .
3 A inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage needed .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the mode of action of the used insulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pine may be the symptoms of adren@@ aline equivalent pre@@ regulation .
animal experiments on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
insulin molecule does not appear in human breast milk , but in general insulin enters neither breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
listed below are listed from clinical trials known to adverse drug discovery , grouped by system organ classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) .

eyel@@ et d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is failed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose up@@ take ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin sensitivity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with Type 1 Diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant met@@ ering range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al action , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al action about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that a similar post @-@ den@@ den@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin molecule 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin levels were wrapped 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ nat@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin molecule is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 million gro@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ iser in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given prior to the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ iser at dose 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
