<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Beural Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl Thinking and Speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar I disruption, a mental disorder where the patients have manic Episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for inserting or melting tablets can be used in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients taking other medicines at the same time, which are also decomposed just like Abilify, Abilify's dose should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aria prazole is thought to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aria prazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but is less effective than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aria prazole contributes to normalizing brain activity, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over 12 weeks to 347 patients with semi-operatiidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by increased unrest associated with lauazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for inserting.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder Abilify reduced manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugar), tremor, nausea, drowsiness, drowsiness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in whom the manic episodes responded to treatment with Arimaprazole, vis-à-vis the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in people with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to approve Abilify's placing across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to treatment with Arianna prazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a 15 mg / day maintenance dose, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration for the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aria prazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aria prazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consider to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aria prazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Arimaprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with aripianzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effects of Aria prazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Arimaprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripibozol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased AUC by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosages of Abilify should be lifted to the dosage height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripian concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripibozol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethoporphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromethoporphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to pregnant during treatment with Arimaprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aria prazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia were observed in patients treated with semi-operatic (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients with Olanthanin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disruption - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Aria prazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-surgery.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS uncovered 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripibozol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aria prazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or estimated acute overdoses of Aripibozol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with AripiPrazol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdose, since Aria prazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Arimaprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aria prazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and in the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-operated study, in week 52, the percentage of respondents adhering to study medication was similar in both groups (Arimaprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Ash depression schedule, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi-operatic.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aria prazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse rate at 34% in the Aria prazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olandite-controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain', an increase in weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Arimaprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing male symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapies study over 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Arimaprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aria prazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-operatic in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12, Aria prazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or semi-operatic.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly did not respond to lithium- or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Arimaprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aria prazole showed superiority to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the elongation and hydroxylography of AripiPrazol, the N-Dealkyung is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean exclusion period is approximately 75 hours for Aripibozol for extensively metabolised metabolites over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific clinical-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences in the ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Arimaprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripibozol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripibozol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was also determined as a result of the precipitation of Aripibozol hydroxy- metabolites in the bile after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the one to three times the average daily dose or 16- to 81x of recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of Sulphate conjugates from Hydroxy- Aripibozol did not show more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dozing, which resulted in expositions of the 3- and 11x of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggitis and behavioural disorders, which were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes caused by bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripipezol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug toxicity (by prescribing or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aria prazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aria prazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mns are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with the dose of Aria prazole in a study in which healthy volunteers Aria prazole (15 mg dose) were used as one-off intramuscularly and who at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripibozol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In comparison to CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosages of Abilify should be lifted to the dosage height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">When 106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotment of Arimaprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripibozol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aria prazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS uncovered 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aria prazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant significant improvements of aggitis / behavioural disorders coupled with placebo and was similar to semi-operatic.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and aggitis and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms in terms of aggibility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepami reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement of the baseline value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour final point was 5.8 for Placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for AripiPrazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggibility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a semi-operatic controlled study, in week 52, the percentage of respondents adhering to study medication was similar in both groups (Arimaprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%.</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with semi-operatic.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aria prazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate, which was at 34% in the Aria prazol- (oral) group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olandite-controlled multi-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain', an increase in weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly did not respond to lithium- or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the supportive therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension of study in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Arimaprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aria prazole showed superiority compared to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety concerns after maternal exposure, 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbit) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional arithmezol (oral) studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of Aripibozol hydroxy- metabolites in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans (mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study, involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in allotment or as a monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time were considered to have no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that in patients the first treatment is no longer more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs, and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other paclitaxel drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the Abraxis BioScience Limited company to permit the use of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing treatment (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy level 3, treatment can be interrupted until improvements are achieved on grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function were conducted and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose-adjusting in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have essentially other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should immediately be stopped and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In the event of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients following the use of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constitious methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and after 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane is advised to not produce a child for up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm count before treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that can affect the transport and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side-effects, which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed below are the side effects associated with the use of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactase hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, hurtful gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, chest pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive link in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence were possible and no causal relationship with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules that promotes the merging of microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilizes microtubules through inhibition of their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transedothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminescence receptor and occurs due to the albumin protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) for paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved infusion studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premeditation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity over paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to finish baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active exposure level (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous injection of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to IV 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available about patients aged over 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be respected when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane flow valve.</seg>
<seg id="327">After adding the solution, the tap water should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the tap water should be gently and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete suspension of the powder is done.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if an own blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Sseamed must be taken under the supervision of a doctor, who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his caretaker, provided that they have received an appropriate instruction.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and for patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems anaemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not sufficiently address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Abseamed was compared to the reference physician.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks before receiving Eprex / Erypo prior to either streamed or continued receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of streamed abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by renal problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Parseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, according to the European Union regulations, a proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas, or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia, at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger surgical interventions that demand a large volume of blood (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">Abseamed can be used to reduce foreign blood before a large electro-orthopedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed in one patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin ability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the sustained haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia and follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin ability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the Retiulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase is increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the recticulation count of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retiulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the rectiulocyte number has increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa-therapy is unlikely and treatment should be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large amounts of iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively present 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of operation and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection may be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from some erythropoetin on erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomy).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboemboils).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported on the appearance of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a decrease in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the report should be determined and the usual causes of non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminio communication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the rectiulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Retiulocytes), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0,5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow should be examined for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an anticorporeal induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetine when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart disease, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In patients with chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should consider a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the b increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adapted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are intended for greater elective orthopaedic surgery should be investigated and treated accordingly before the onset of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disease, especially in underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, epoetin alfa for patients with an initial himoan value of &gt; 13 g / dl may be an increased risk of post-post thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a hemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to the growing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">From in-vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Through thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, neurysm, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys, patients with epoetin alfa were reported.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovasculary events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients receiving erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="433">Irrespective of erythropoetin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycosilicated and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrates with the endogenous human erythropoetin which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoiesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with recombinant human erythropoetin were consistent with anaemia due to several common malignomas consistent, statistically significant higher mortality compared to the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumor patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin alfa drugs after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bone brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including patients who recently suffered from a lower traumatic hip as in Hinfra; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injections into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Paget's disease, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate asclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8,000 elderly women were involved in osteoporosis, and the number of spinal and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood was normalized or decreased at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients with Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures by 41% was reduced by 41% compared to all patients with Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of the patients below Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients taking placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta's side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to infusion and osteoarthritis (die of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>

<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the disease Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the Gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen briefly after the application of apclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with a kidney function (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, since data on harmlessness and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokaltsemia may develop, whose maximum typically occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer (chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who require dental intervention, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administering Aclasta can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen briefly after the application of apclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who received Aclasta increased (1,3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 out of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The prevalence of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders, which have been associated as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine clearance (measured yearly prior to administration) and the onset of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were compared in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclaim- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of therapy was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Paget trials (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administering Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the infusion center, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoarthritis in the jaw area was covered mainly in cancer patients, over osteonekrosis (primary in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoneclipsis in the jaw area at one with Aclasta and patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, the dose of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post-menopausal women (7,736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD T-Score for the Schenkelhoe ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric vertebrate fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on fractures Aclasta showed an equal lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar folic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 increase in bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip around 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the basin comb after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with Aclasta in comparison to placebo an increase in trabecular bone volumes and the retention of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose was significantly reduced by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscularly) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In HORIZON RFT study Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% to the overall penal and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients BMD was judged after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% with Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients over 30 years with radiological confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.5-fold up to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control in comparison to the baseline value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a responder at the end of the six-month study (referred to therapy) could be included in a follow-up period.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronate, could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of zoledronic acid lasting from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large circulation cycle with half-value times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of half a ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution stages (α and β, with the t ½ -values mentioned above) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearing amounts regardless of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledronic acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a mild (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min. no dose-adjustment of zoledronic acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only limited data for serious kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC, 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerance of zoledronic acid in rats was administered; in dogs a 15- minute infusion was administered 0,25 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose, corresponding to the 7fold of human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tracts and liver, as well as intravenous intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats one observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget's disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In Paget's disease, bone reconstruction is too fast and new bone material is set up unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Beural Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), metformin alone cannot be adequately adjusted in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfylic resp or insulin, the current dose of the sulphonyl resins or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonylurea and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was evaluated in triple therapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition, they received Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were used.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of the additional dose of acetonide for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylic resins showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c values, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin reported reduction of HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high corp levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients in the form of monotherapy, in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited authorization for Actos' placing in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients aged under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in cardiac insufficiency reports, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output hepatic cells (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3-times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torchiness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone continues, should be guided by the clinical assessment until the outcome of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be accumulated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution following treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4%) and haemoglobin by 1-2% and haemoglobin by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia is the result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pioglitazone as orally double- or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under treatment with thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but adequate physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events on bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The expected fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is to be treated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not appreciated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index of refraction of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials involving pioglitazone, ALT ascents often appear to be less than placebo, but less rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylic resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if pioglitazone or.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been rarely reported about heart failure among pioglitazone, more often when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparable medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucosine production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazone versus Gliclasty as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the treatment a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials for one year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly higher LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the overall plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under pioglitazone, while measured values were observed in metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the grooglyceride level but also improved the post-prandial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular diseases.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with the peak concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is equivalent to the threefold of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination period of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 to 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother's substance resemble themselves.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy was observed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with pioglitazone and decreases the availability of metabolic substrates for foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindian resulted in increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or gliclacide have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the grooglyceride level but also improved the post-prandial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on the Tryglyceride level as well as the hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study found the objective of their primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary reascularization and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package supplement).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the Novo Nordisk A / S company to approve Actraphane traffic across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is enhanced by intensified insulin therapy, for example, can significantly change hypoglycemia and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), insulin type (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA against insulin origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore needs to consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always after other medications taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the administration site Gelegrine - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylatic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity, including generalised rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, low blood pressure and impotence / unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia may, however, develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the actual maximum is achieved within 2 to 8 hours, and the entire active duration amounts up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid resp. delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fission (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule have been considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, pre-clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane piercing bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before resuspened according to the operating instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor therefore needs to consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always after other medications taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Subjects were the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Febuxostat Exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily had an average 22% increase in AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be related to side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experiments do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostat group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1,3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disorder and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with Colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">In the open long term extension studies, 906 patients have been treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg treated.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostat- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term renewal studies (up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the statements occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypanaesthesia, showy ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin discoloration, skin lesions, bursitis, protein urie, renal insufficiency, lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">In humans, the active mechanism of uric acid is the end product of the purinmetabolism and develops in the context of the reaction chain Hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for the in vitro inhibitor located below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical trial results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX Study and FACT study as described below), conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serumpernacacid levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum for study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.2 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed a statistically significant superiority both in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum cholesterol values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.2 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for analyses. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Lowering of serum acid level to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cholesterol values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>

<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily).</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage of serum acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunction).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data gathered in the open extension study of phase 3 demonstrated in two years that the permanent reduction in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment for a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment for a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the galletium, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the top nodes up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- Values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term renewal studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant changes in the percentage of serum acid concentration were observed, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (ss / F) from Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasmaprotein binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to Albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms, these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid occurs mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxoat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as immutable Febuxostat (30%), its well known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, about 45% of the dose in the chair could be found as unmodified Febuxostat (12%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to normal kidney function subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver functional restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Classification B) liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to normal liver function subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes observed with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after intake of multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, in about 11-fold exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a consequence of a specific purinmetabolisation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been noted that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about threefold of human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a developmental retardation in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, which are approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which are approximately 13 times of the human therapeutic exposure, yielded no teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1252">According to the CHMP Guideline, an updated RMP can be submitted to risk management systems for human pharmaceutical products with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).</seg>
<seg id="1253">An update of the RMP is required • when new information is available which have an impact on safety data, pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimization activities • within 60 days of reaching important milestones (pharmacovigilance or risk minimization) • on request of EMEA</seg>
<seg id="1254">In some people, uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid is insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the crystallization is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved with time.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC must not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine, if you have a heart failure or have a heart problem. • If you suffer from a high urinary acid concentration in the wake of a cancer illness or the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital disorder where there is too much uric acid in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a toxin at the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, feeling of warmth and joint swelling), wait until the gout decay is clarified before you begin treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be in any case, but may also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a gout case or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used other medicines, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking drugs / using any of the following substances since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may need to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (to treat the immune system) • Theophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood diluting in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on transport and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Please use ADENURIC only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intolerance to certain sugars.</seg>
<seg id="1265">On the back of the blister pack, the individual days of the week are printed, so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day.</seg>
<seg id="1266">If you have unintentionally taken an overdose, contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1267">If you have forgotten the intake of ADENURIC, take it as soon as possible unless the next dose is imminent.</seg>
<seg id="1268">If you stop taking ADENURIC, your uric acid concentration can increase again, and your discomfort can worsen because new uranium crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings.</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease where bone is brittle) in women after menopause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received Alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicate that the Alendronate dosage contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the same dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcer (ulcera), ulcers, irritated abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as oxygen bumping.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components, ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in cases of esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1285">In January 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to Merck Sharp & Doha Ltd to approve ADROVANCE in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Capsular, white to broken white tablets, marked with the outline of a bone on one side and "710" on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only available with water (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following information is to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">For example, peptic ulcerus, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplastic, must be given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, horophageal Ulzera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal striktures, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point out possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of esophageal irritation, such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retroviral pain, or worsening heartburn.</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who don't take the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, gastric and duodenalulcera, among them some serious and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regimen mainly administered intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available to indicate whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a maxillary surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the planning of therapy in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE, after noticing their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should likewise be adequately treated with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of Alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendra's clinical trials were taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports come from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, the serum calciums received up to &lt; 8.0 mmol / l (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to 2,0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1315">After 15 weeks of treatment, the average serum levels of 25-hydroxyprovitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the group under ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) than in the group under Alendronate alone (46 nmol / l [18.2 ng / ml]).</seg>
<seg id="1316">ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum value of 25-hydroxyprovitamin D &lt; 37.5 nmol / l [&lt; 15 ng / l [&lt; 15 ng / l]) by 62.5% compared to Alendronate alone (12% vs.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Studies with Alendronat once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6,459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III studies, the average BMD ascents with alendronate at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the vertebral column, 5.9% on the femur hanger and 7.8% on the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronate, a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% compared to placebo 6.3%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of the spine and trochanter continued to stop; also the BMD of the femur neck and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials, where Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg. daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of Alendronate reduced the incidence of at least 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption of an intravenous reference dose was the average oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Alendronate is temporarily dispersed in soft tissue after intravenous injection of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly circulated into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After the intravenous dose of a single dose of 14C-Alendronat approximately 50% of the radioactive substance had excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the feces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After an intravenous dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted from the kidneys via the kidneys or alkaline transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant was necessary or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraph is absorbed by the body compared to prograf / prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Advantine dosage ought to be based primarily on clinical assessment of abortion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the tacrolimus bottom mirrors should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4 systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable with both formulations in both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate nightransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the agraf-dose-chemical can take several days until Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For suppression of the transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - Kidney Transplantation Prevention of Graft rejection The oral Advantine therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advantine therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion of Prograf to Advagraf must be a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this changeover has to occur in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunosuppressants to advagraph once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral starting dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplant for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation With adult patients who are converted to Advagraph, an oral initial dosage of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients - although there is no clinical experience with advagraph in lung, pankful and intestine-transplanted patients, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in diabetic transplant patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with limited renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels, a calculation of creatininates and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advantf In the transition from a ciclosporto to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of abortion and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred-tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks following transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion of prograf to advagraph, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time using substances that could alter the tacrolimus-whole blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a low-clearance drug, adaptations of the dose may take several days until Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the tallow in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the sebaceous levels of Tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 to 20 ng / ml and at 10 to 20 ng / ml of transplant and heart transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or excess-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory compared to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the secretarised formulation of Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the retarised formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimia in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies is to be avoided during treatment with advagraph (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimia concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a cardiomyopathy identified as a cardiomyopathy, which can therefore occur under advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus are symptoms of PRES like headache, altered state of consciousness, cramps and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>
<seg id="1449">In patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, Advagraf hard capsules, retarert, lactose, are especially advised.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is advisable to monitor the Tacrolimia blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effects of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures can be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that Tacrolimus could potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for potential adverse effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hypercalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The adverse event profile of immunosuppressant drugs is often not determined precisely because of the patient's underlying disease and the concurrent treatment with a large number of other drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1462">The side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order: very often (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10.000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (frequency based on available data not invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with treatment with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysifiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are expected to acquire the effects of tacrolimus by binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell inns.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This results in a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphoid genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies assessed observations in the large studies in which prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multicenter study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported that received either tacrolimus or ciclosporin as part of 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis, obliteral syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolimia and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis was compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were killed by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection rate was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Graft 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis of obliteral syndrome in the patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-centric study of oral prograf was carried out to 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which were treated by a randomized trial tacrolimus (n = 103) or ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study of oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation demonstrated an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional injection of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses ranging from 10 to 15 ng / ml and recent transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly carried out via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were switched from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraph (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of VIII factor.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advance is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hammophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleedings with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advant may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted the Baxter AG a permit for the import of lawyers across the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of VIII deficiency, the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not sink below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma crossbars is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, varying in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis The long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose, a test must be carried out to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration is to follow after finding the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestically known inhibitors development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there is no experience of using Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs, which occurred in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who had a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop of the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and the factor VIII- levels in plasma and the clearance rate again showed adequate values on the 15th day of the postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate Hastophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">Moreover, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected after exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial constituted 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend as well as a continuing peak of the antibody-mirror against anti-CHO cell protein, but there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the appearance of Urtikaria, Pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophile granulocytes was reported in several repeated product specifications as part of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylatic / anaphylaktoider reactions (frequency unknown).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the advancement of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and cannot cause infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advance could have directly injected into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to regenerate normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to the killing of the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni's cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni's cancer occurred in the area of undergrowth, in bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions presented to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP issued a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not adequately proven that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficiently that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and up, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be traced back to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients who took aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a 37.4% reduction in symptoms compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should not be used in patients who suffer from an anesoprhagic effect (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to approve the transfer of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on the harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term application may decrease the activity of Pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocrititin, pergoid, dihydroergotamine or other deongesttiva, which can be performed perally or nasal (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with a kidney or liver function disorder and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening the headache) must be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, in the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotoric tests revealed no significant differences between the patients treated with the patients and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not they were taken with alcohol alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that may lead to impaired mobility or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with potential lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, agitated miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordimental pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-drought, pupil starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 mg. daily there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total scores for the symptoms (except the nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">Efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics by Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers for 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin had bad metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study reveals that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent after the sole injection of Pseudoephedrine's bioequivalent was to exposure after gift of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin can no longer identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed were generally related to the substance pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, can develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drinking or itchy eyes with constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart chasing, heart palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are using Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken medicine, even if it is a non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When used in recommended dosage, it is not possible to calculate that aerosaze leads to dizziness or allocates attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze when you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the given time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, hives) or skin rash are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of eye-catching liver attacks were also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat (soluble tablets), 2.5 Mg- and 5 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged 6 to 11, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius has been studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by investigating the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of Urtikaria, the decrease in symptom scores after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to authorize the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy of the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the clinical course of the disease and may be resumed after the symptoms have been removed and resumed during their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be advised that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that may lead to impaired mobility or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients who were treated with a lost loratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were given.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes, as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of total scores for quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was also studied for other forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine replacement is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of the Urticaria, desloratadin may also improve the symptoms in other forms of the Urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with chloroatadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and waxing significantly, as was measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patient demographics were comparable to the general, seasonal rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation, once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, DESloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin can no longer identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise desloratadin and experience a higher exposure strain (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which can be metabolized, is identical to that in children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomerase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall prevalence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius Sirup group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company resumes its application for Aflunov's placing on the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily be spread by humans to humans because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Once the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form an antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), was purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">The extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suffice to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need further information regarding your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, amatease is available as a solution for inclusion, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Amatease should only be prescribed if the doctor checked the antiviral drugs of the patient before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day, taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and 12 years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of amatease is directed after body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other anti-viral drugs, amatease reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot cure, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low-dosed Ritonavir drug Agenerase was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, more patients had viral load below 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, asgenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few people responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase strengthened viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenase together with Ritonavir had a greater decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asgenera (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement to treat depression) or drugs that are also degraded as well as amatease and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asgenerase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (dying of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Amatease is usually taken together with Ritonavir pharmacokinetic amplifier, but the committee found that the benefits of amatease in combination with Ritonavir were not proven in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited company to permit the use of asgenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, amprenase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic packs of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking account of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is by 14% less than by amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asgenerational capsules and solution for admission on one milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for amatease capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the amplifying addition of Ritchie avir (booster), higher doses of amatease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amatease in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of amatease capsules in adult patients with a medioccured liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and, moreover, represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that amatease or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with amatease, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver abnormalities with potentially fatal disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of concurrent antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids, including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of eivastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available for determining the active ingredient concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, amprenavir may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolic content of the Agenerase Solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amatease should be set off in duration 5, if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-related factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In the event of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to serious clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eetiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneclipsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV / AIDS and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given together with pharmaceuticals whose active agents are metabolised predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes 82% reduction of AUC by Amprenavir, which may lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often adverse effects were observed on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, by contrast, for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decrease when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given; however, close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was conducted to use asgenerase in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antazidi component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase differ for at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is not necessary in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may decrease serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmpips.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin will fall to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with amatease in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may cause interactions when used together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is recommended that antacids do not be taken at the same time as asgenerase because it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Israeldipine, Nizdipine, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nizdipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with asgenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day), the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% -interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous use of amatease with Ritonavir and these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma levels at the same time administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhinitis polysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the present administration of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenera must not be used together with oral Midazolam (see section 4.3) while caution is advised with parenteral midazolam while using asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasmhole of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fader.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the amprenavirus dose when amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Autoised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predicable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time using amatease (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During the pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk-lacing rats but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to the mother's milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early on and rarely led to treatment termination.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the use of asgenera or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were assessed by investigators as in connection with the study medication, and were performed in more than 1% of the patients, and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and differential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitches) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTIs performed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macro-papulous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be stopped with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoneksis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the event of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low dosed Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who were observed under allotase treatment. exceptions were increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were observed very frequently in patients who received asgenerase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is indicative of signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-poly polyproteinstages with the result of an education inmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in cases of chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The correlation between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, the described mutations were rarely observed with protease inhibitors, as with other Ritonavir inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, where 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, I84V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I84V, I85V, I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In APV30003 and APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors performed over 96 weeks following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Otypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testings can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testings can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There is currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistence paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral antibodies that failed to cause an Fosamprenavirus (one of which demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which UPI treated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTIs were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-submitability of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average variation of the baseline value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-vacuum threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenera is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, 152 of which were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution for insertion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unbiased" "" "asgenerase should be considered during treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the mean duration (tmax) to the maximal serum concentration of amprenavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">If Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was given for CMAx by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume and an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unused amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents varies depending on the total dose concentration in the Steady State via the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 have to be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of amatease capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a renal function disturbance should be low on the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemas lead to amprenavir plasma levels similar to those obtained at healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous appointment of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occurred in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanisms for the development of hepatogenic adenomas and carcinomas were not clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro toxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test on rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity in patients has yet been observed in clinical studies, either during the administration of amatease or after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the control and the animals treated with the amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma-exposure significantly higher (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dose in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus gongation and minor changes in skeletal changes, which indicate delayed development.</seg>

<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in the treatment of genital warts in Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of patients with Imiquimod overall, the genital warts healed completely; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary super-cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study of four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated were clinically cured and remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairless scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external tilt, actinic keratosis and superfictional basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed with three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / poor (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application was low on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; another study carried out for the dermal application for four months did not show similar effects for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with three days a week did not induce tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod is only a small systemic absorption out of the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used in patients with a proven diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by investigating its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over 5 years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of pulmonary function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of aldurazyme will observe patients receiving aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to authorize the transport of aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammals cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated in patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyms should only occur in an appropriate clinical setting, where revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against laronidase are usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment must be cautiously preceded.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistamines and / or antihistamines), to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rates to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data in newborns exposed to mother's milk in relation to laronidase, it is recommended to not feed with aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to aldurazyms that were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions were observed, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesirable drug interactions in connection with aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe form of follow-up and a duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of serum in patients aged less than 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or to early retirement from the study), no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients with whom it never came to serum.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels had a robust decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which seemed to not impair clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme substitution therapy lies in a recovery of enzyme activity in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substratum and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken from cells to the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that had the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of the patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyme every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement of the lung function and the ability to go, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV over this period is not clinically significant and the total lung volume increases proportionally to the size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of GAG levels in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into consideration by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes consisted of five efficacy variables (expected to be expected) in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year, open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe expiration form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group. younger patients with a severe form of traverse (&lt; 2.5 years) showed normal mental development speed, whereas older patients with severe form of course were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme dosing schemas were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemas is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in one-off administration, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, pre-clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not yet been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, an "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin experienced an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months for docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival times when administering Alimta than with the comparative drug.</seg>

<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with Cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for large-scale epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with small choroidal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours, approximately 30 minutes after completion of Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed Gift and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first fixed dose and after each third movement cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a full blood picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-check must take place taking account of the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Following the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient receives the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials do not indicate that in patients with 65 years of age or above, there is an increased risk of side effects when compared to patients aged 65 and older.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments in patients with a creatine-clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were necessary, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper biliruby limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not examined specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with respect to bone and immunosuppression before their absolute neutrology number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombosis cycles again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was treated if pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred were risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, prevalent hypertension, or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulations in the transellular region, a drainage of the effusion before the pemetrexed treatment is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed, if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible edification of reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out in front of the treatment inn to obtain advice on the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to reduced Pemetremixed elimination with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal renal function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with NSAIDs with a long half-life such as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy required increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Autoised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">No data is available for use in pregnant women, but as for any antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Fixed may not be applied during pregnancy, except when demanding and after careful balancing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning to obtain advice on the spermatological service.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that performs its action by disrupting important, folate metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies, Pemetremixed acts as an antifolate with several points of attack by blocking the thymidymis synthase (DHFR) and glycine amidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients treated only with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) related to the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (218 patients) in the use of the Lun- genomesothelioma.</seg>

<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low-calorie, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients taking Alli and taking no weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are hammered, they cannot drain some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats taken with the food unbarking the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with placebo in 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies on patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who had alli 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains on after, flatus (winch) with stucco, stool, greasy / oily chair, discharge oily secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which non-sufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited company to approve orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypokalory, fat-based diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">"" "" "" "alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety." ""</seg>
<seg id="2515">As orlistat is only absorbed minimally, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or renal function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who are alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant precautions in order to prevent the oral contraception observed in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally normal-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, before bedtime a complementary multivitamin supplement should be taken to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of one single dose Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal properties and are related to pharmacological effects of the drug, since the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal adverse events were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of reported side-effects found after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days in normal weighty and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the introduction of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipassivating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, fatty acid diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the baseline value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight during the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg - 3.5% (baseline value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Laconring) and M3 (M1, after separation of the N-Formyl leucine group), were identified in a study with adipous patients, namely M1 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl leucine group), representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2570">How to set up your calorie and fetal boundaries, please find more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you leave a meal or have a meal with no fat, don't take any capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in combination with a meal containing too much fat, risk diet-related side effects (see Section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to new eating habits, start before the first capsule intake with a diet of calorie and fat.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Dietary diaries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To safely reach your target weight, you should set two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Nutrition to reduce the likelihood of nutritional supplements (see section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not accustomed to physical activity. • Stay physically active while taking and after finishing the intake of alli.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: • Begin for a few days, or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a low-fat diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat rich main court or a substantial Nachtisch- as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction. • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep out of reach of children. • Do not apply drugs to children after the expiry date specified on the carton. • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Silicagel, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Do not swallow it in any case. • You can use your daily dose of alli in the blue transport box (shuttle) with this pack.</seg>

<seg id="2596">A permanent weight loss, for example by improving nutrition and more exercise, can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as an indication of food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Keep in mind the tables below. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">For the amount of calories you can use, refer to the information below, which indicates the number of calories suitable for you. • Due to the mode of action of the capsule, compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By complying with recommended fat intake, you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likelihood of nutritional supplements.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight by gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low-physical activity" means that you daily burn down stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Medium physical activity" means that you exercise 150 kcal per day, for example 3 km of walking, 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and also to observe them. • Imagine is a food diary with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on calorie and fat-duously and give guidelines to become more physically active.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies that are powerful triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alohxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroid (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are powerful triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloo showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloo showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients receiving ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alohxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by strong emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palmonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapy administration, Aloxi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palatosetron did not block the activity of the five chemotherapeutics studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical trial showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A population-based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, celecoxib, dioxetine, chinidine, ranitidine, Ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the cycinetic Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the use of palatosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palatosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 mcg (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an alohm overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and 250mg Palonosetron were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 mcg of Palonosetron were compared to patients given intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palatosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous cytometron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations following a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0,3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palatosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the total composition (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palatosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination following an intravenous dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous injektion in healthy patients the total body serum was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function disturb the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. preclinical studies indicate that Palatosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in the ventricular degeneration and repolarization and can prolong the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose accounted for about 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans) that were given daily for two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the marketing authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also known as" "" "reference medicine" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-prolonged) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue has damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are further increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA) which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon's manufacturer presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference physician.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been raised that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to market cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retarded again in more patients than with the reference doctor; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study used in the study was not sufficiently validated to determine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (cracking or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provable or presumably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients with placebo discussed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body's tissue) or from infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected little infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the transport of altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy may be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitising or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin ointment the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after 2-3 days treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retinotinulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on the skinned skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary when topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the effects on the birth and the foetus / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinamulin is preferable to the use of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the treatment with altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was the administration location which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passwort (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline impedes the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosome subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some infectious forms seems questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and isolated skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 skimmed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolismin retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats microcore test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in a maximum estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skimmed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were detected in oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization, and it is ensured that the inoculation plan, consisting of two doses, can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccinated Twinrix Adup, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccines approved since 1997 - Twinrix.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix ults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 doses of vaccine) are headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a licence for placing Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The immunization plan for the immunization with Ambirix is made up of two doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection vaccine is desired for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated with appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HBsAg) anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent people who responded to a Hepatitis Avaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even with non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, for the rare case of anaphylatic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is achieved, so that additional doses can be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intrastromal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impeller success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix in the second year in form of a separate injection was administered simultaneously with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary to assume that there is no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matureness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerase and preservative-containing formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines aged between 1 and 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and accuracy on a calculation base per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matching was comparable per proband (i.e. over the total vaccination cycle of 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix in comparison with 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matchiness was low and comparable to the one observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units with form-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formally inactivated Hepatitis B and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies conducted at vaccines between 1 and 15 years of age, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dosage (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs seroconversion rates were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dosage (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The 289 people whose immunogenicity was invaluable were the seroprotective rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360-ELISA units of form-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years at the time of immunization, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formally inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-old, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to the 0-6-months vaccination scheme, compared to the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the intake of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient on all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present wording in adults showed similar seroprotective and serum levels similar to previous wording for the current formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined both before and after the resusencode on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in water contaminated by effluents.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus, even though the complete series of vaccines has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B prior to the administration of both vaccines, vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis C or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any ingredient of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have already an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, ambient pressure is applied to persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child is subjected to a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 tell your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / her child has been vaccinated recently, or if you / her child has been vaccinated or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have received / or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different extremities as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have become known since the first approval of the inverter, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only marketed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split by several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered by a gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste problems, or taste inversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "given only limited information on this medicine at the time of admission." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-maniac form (incomplete enzyme defect, which is manifested after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake required for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethincarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing problems as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it was a slowdown of neuronal propagation and increased neurons loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed stimulation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted to the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation period is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 to 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inflow, and the disease itself was leading to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with the nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidney, including phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat at sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Following an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurement of measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate was determined 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with circulatory disorders or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrats (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) were detectable in the following morning after nocturnal fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma percentage were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated phenylacetylglutamine product.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus's results, sodium phenylbutyrate did not have a complained effect in toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomia or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethincarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, it came to lesions in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on research on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that a sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 to 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">Following an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products which accumulate after eating proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are going to carry out laboratory tests, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), such as unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox during allotment or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remained in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or a year in order to prevent new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization).</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox in reference to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudine, other Hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had hemorrhage, as well as in people with high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to authorize the transport of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose of initialdose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous 0.1 mg / kg infusion, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure a stub of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allotting bolus administration of angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the dose dose may be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney dysfunction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT again to check the ACT 5 minutes after the second stun dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirinal Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated leparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Severe hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible hemocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most of the hemorrhages in PCI patients suffer from arterial points, patients who undergo a percutaneous koronarintervention (PCI) may undergo bleeding all over the course of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of INR (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudine is once again reached the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytica or thrombocyte aggregate), it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with thrombocyte units or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxoxin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudine group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for heavy bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidated and GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma or bleeding in the point range, with a reduction of the haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood ligicalisations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctures, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudine in 6000 patients who have undergone a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes listed in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately to be stopped and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudine, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudine to Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turns the bond of Bivalirudine-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, whereby the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduciated thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce platelet aggregation reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudine shows a dose-dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is proven by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI is carried out below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the Acuity study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with an unstable angina / non-ST birth infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisine is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot effectively handle insulin, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with Type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to 0.14% in insulin lisp was noted after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin molecule or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Sanofi-Aventis German GmbH to approve Apidra's placing in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the amount of insulin, the brand's (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage needed.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the mode of action of the used insulin and can therefore change during conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of Sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpine may be the symptoms of adrenaline equivalent preregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">Insulin molecule does not appear in human breast milk, but in general insulin enters neither breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed from clinical trials known to adverse drug discovery, grouped by system organ classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welness, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Eyelet dystrophy is failed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose uptake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin sensitivity in subcutaneous GA- be occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with Type 1 Diabetes melli- tus insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant metering range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosal effect, and 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosal action, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucosal action about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that a similar post-dendenal glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin molecule 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin levels were wrapped 2 minutes before the meal, a better postnatal control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin molecule is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 million grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-luliser in 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given prior to the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-luliser at dose 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
