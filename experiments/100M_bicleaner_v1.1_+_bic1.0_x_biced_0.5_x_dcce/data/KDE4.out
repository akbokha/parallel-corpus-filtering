the module website can be translated in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . select from the drop @-@ down list the output and target language of the translation .
if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated instead of the entire &amp; URL .
machine translation is very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Baby@@ lon@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made depending on the translation without first checking the translation beforehand .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert texts into translation directly .
the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools Ab@@ crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if any , delete .
the module view filter ( also known as the folder filter ) is available in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different types .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M from the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ node , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the particul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower object objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder is the size of a file or folder . this way , large files can be easily detected , even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View colour mode , can either represent depth for the easy recognition of the merge depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area should be used by subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View the rule should be comp@@ lied with . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . it is drawn frames to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework needs space , which is then not available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frame to create rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View menu item . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the image gallery , a dialog opens , allowing you to set up the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the gallery page title in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the image file name of the image indicate whether the file names are displayed in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
when viewing the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you can determine if the size of the pictures is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the file selection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save in HTML &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when connecting sub@@ folders with the check box , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the original images check box , you can determine if the original images are to be copied into the gallery .
using the comment text check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails in the check box as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings allows you easy access to the general &amp; html settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; html settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media reproduction for the navigation area in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu in the navigation area or using the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for certain domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the M@@ SI@@ E code for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; html ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the set browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module you will check your &amp; CSS ; style templates and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ pack ; easy to use , there are dozens of professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also a digi@@ pack ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry problems or requests .... This will open a dialogue with a signed link . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can also visit the digi@@ pa@@ edia ; visit homepage for news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best way to get involved is to register in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ code ; first start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the upper@@ most folder that contains pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; looks at every sub@@ folder as an album .
&amp; digi@@ code ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is hidden in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera in &amp; digi@@ kam . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it may be possible to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu aid menu .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h procedures sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a USB mass storage device . it can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever @-@ increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so the preview images of digi@@ k@@ am can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may see thumb@@ nails , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ pa@@ h ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to provide K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function , when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and holding images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be dropped in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to make the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter will work on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is shown in the symbol view .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ites or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose Album Im@@ ported images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . you can move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select the album properties menu in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete albums after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort .
the El@@ ders &apos; buttons , average , new test@@ ers : these set the date on the oldest , the most recent image or the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ pack ; open , the first picture is selected in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the right mouse button in the context menu &amp; quot ; Set as album preview . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the preview images are generated . you can avoid using this in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can change the digi@@ code settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons , which appear when you leave the mouse poin@@ ter at a moment above a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the words of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all what the digi@@ pack is all about . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select . image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos . image editing can be used to view and edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs can result in problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right @-@ click the preview and select shoot . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the thumb@@ nail and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ pack ; delete it , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can therefore also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the tags are re @-@ imported at the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam ; the pictures noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keywords &apos; ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this becomes the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My keywords &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the pop @-@ up preview in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to handle the functionality with keywords , you must first have your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to it . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select from the context menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a chron@@ ologically adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the box , which indicates the time unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ end he search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found nothing , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and the search is performed . the Find list view is used to assign a name to My Search List . if you want to change your selection after search again , select only the appropriate entry from the View My Search List and select an option in its pop @-@ up menu .
if you choose to edit a search , the search will appear with the search information previously entered . if you select as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the Search button in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it . each option can be linked to others by the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; character@@ izes any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : draw @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ pack ; find the matching pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab offers an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ aire from the pop @-@ up menu . the selection will be added to the lighted table and its window will be opened .
from the preview panel you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window and drop it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a series of images . if you browse combination mode from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . the picture shown on the right is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal fire actions also work directly out of the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can recognize along the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you have to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure , find , protect and use your images . we will focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ pack ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing up , searching , archiving , archiving , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data via data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a particular photo without stock management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ pack ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; Note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were able to organize several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save the metadata option in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data is written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? to do this , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now choose any picture of words , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value .
let us now with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam will automatically build the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very crude representation as each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let most of you just see your photos , they want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motif that moved you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the move of the spatial presentation is now already with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using imagery with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization may be used .
author title : linked with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work description . examples can be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or Independent Commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machine can delete or change this image embedded in the image . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ pa@@ ed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even with traditional paper sn@@ ap@@ shots or neg@@ atives . in this section you &apos;ll find problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you are just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray Disc can store 50 GB and almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good recorder to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ es@@ ent format . after that , read the data to check for you . likewise , you must copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then transfer them to a clean , dark dry and safe environment .
your manufacturer &apos;s ass@@ or@@ ations cover a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives to this subject : flo@@ ppy error study
in a nut@@ shell : disks hold the longest if you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in the case of lower temperature tours , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T fail to notice the imminent failure . this is especially reading eh@@ ler and shift counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical appliances do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , loss of hardware , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and creates the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage sh@@ utter that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while a over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run down the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current troubles with cost avoid@@ ance . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering that allows you to store any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are provided on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution Online .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies include a backup and a distributed storage in the offer . thus , they are disaster @-@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody says to you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . please read this article in English .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms as the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at workplace systems . not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most think@@ ers think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are going towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to wor@@ sen . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . therefore , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will have you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane spending : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
hence disaster prevention always means no local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another benefit of the physical separation : as said above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts only r@@ sync copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file , retained X@@ MP files , retain original memory , scal@@ ability , media , recover images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to be careful and re @-@ evaluate all that is told today . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and want to increase the area you want to increase on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ I ; # works with ext@@ 3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of a f@@ anned if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can save gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardi@@ ze camera output formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing D@@ NG and we hope to use both Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ls@@ quot ; that stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers pull it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera media , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archives . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images back with the digi@@ pack ; edit , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ pack ; to get . in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an album you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is established , a final indicator appears at the lower end and the preview images of all photos on the camera are displayed .
before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Tab@@ s metadata tells the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the Met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available on some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button to download and then download all of them . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select the selected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are downloading the buttons or download the selected ones , a dialog appears where you can select the target album where the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ pack ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at one time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must first select it and delete the selected ones .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were downloaded successfully in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; -@@ album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should do so via the camera system because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options , which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % % H : % M : % S in the edit field . turn off the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ code ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ code ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced Edit button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it is stored &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced Settings button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is finished , asked &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you see where the pictures are to be uploaded . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this means a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map out an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er and map references .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the primitive signs of ha@@ iry coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over its work sequences as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change the Settings menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or Image Processing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the respective IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should include names such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description to the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate who works the photo . this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not just in the &amp; digi@@ pack database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cur@@ sor hangs over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ pack ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ pack ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam will attempt , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset again by clicking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the right of each category . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ code ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sample means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the setting of P@@ NG comp@@ ressing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
the TI@@ FF file option comp@@ resses the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image slightly soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sharp@@ ness . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings , because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ pack ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rest@@ ore option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be adjusted for each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the digi@@ pack ; editing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of partial raw data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and that a matrix of color pixels is available .
&amp; digi@@ code ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , since it is carried out during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a color space to the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ ders Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ less not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are further options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate on how to recover your image from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them for what . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ code ; many modules written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ pack ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ti@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch off the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties on the left side provide a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button Automatic Identi@@ fication that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the display mode .
at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera bar . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check whether &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find further details when you delete a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without queries . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button changes .
you can also see the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; stopping when starting . this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam .
the setting Bei@@ m Start for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , asked &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ pack ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected among Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these themes have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ pack ; to create , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the View / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save file or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button or the button &quot; Rest@@ ore Image Edi@@ ting &quot; button in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since last saving .
almost any image processing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can undo the last action by editing undo or re@@ covering by selecting Edit restore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switching Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB above the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select the magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you get to the normal view where you are using the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do so , you can change it in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the picture in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ porting Print As@@ sist . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab to let the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the label view you can insert or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you commented it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the pop @-@ up menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree , and a box with the keywords applied earlier in this &amp; digi@@ pack ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword in question . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved to the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a keyword with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section .
the side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply draw it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to bet the keyword .
in the upper case , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on K@@ eine keyword , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree has been selected and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Vari@@ ables .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image issues are via email or web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why use a different color space and thus have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then About About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB outputs the circle . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any more manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , balance , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast extend from the menu Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
comparison : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes , the balance generates very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic lev@@ elling : this method maximizes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hi@@ sto@@ grams range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible area and a re@@ organization of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ny@@ m . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the thumb@@ nail image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
this hist@@ ogram is very useful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow Justi@@ fication lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the save as and load buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of blan@@ ks . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted by the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always makes the same mistake and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in the colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the colour effects are provided by four colour effects , a sol@@ ar@@ isation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when one partially developed a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approximately 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase ultimately creates a negative image that so does not produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it deals the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments you can look at in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool sound value correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog appears to be very complicated for this tool , you need only the area of the slider for the application explained here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three slide bars are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes .
the original and preview of the image can be previ@@ ew@@ ed on the right . the preview will be updated dynamically using the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this drop @-@ down box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the mid frequencies , often called g@@ amma ratings .
the three color pin@@ points can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a full automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light picture as a background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : this button sets the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modified Channel : this drop @-@ down box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of the most sensible . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you shift a short arrow to the right , for example the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with darker markings and that the accompanying image pixels become darker .
a red marker is shown on the preview of the original photo . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you are not found in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pack channel mixer ; Image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
select the color for the hist@@ ogram with the channel selection box : this gives you a first indication how you can adjust the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel bl@@ ender will then be THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions to your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save and load buttons are used for precisely this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz must be preserved . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) to see .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ qui@@ er . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ amp@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
by using the &amp; digi@@ pack ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bending it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any point . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text display , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them .
every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the menu template template uses in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ish the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template , just send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ liste digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button &apos;s base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the templates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob magni@@ fies the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . just take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
JPEG images are often used for camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of sharp@@ ness already during reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo by sharpen@@ ing the focus . you can call this with the menu item Con@@ duc@@ ting Schär@@ ding .
but you should handle this carefully because the results are not very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for a soft sign with the menu item Con@@ duc@@ ting soft @-@ drawing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right hand side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ en@@ ades are produced near sharp edges .
the radi@@ us determines how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ est pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . this sets the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from the shar@@ per and thus avoid beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ ple@@ tion filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focused &quot; quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to s@@ me@@ ar the image further .
this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ red filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used for exactly this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to complete all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave later unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as a JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp masks a larger neighbourhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienn@@ ese filter one can show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing the field of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the slider sets the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the tin@@ plate allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab and advanced settings .
details preserve p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is subsequently necessary . please note that the detail preservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependency .
direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value is smoo@@ thed to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD smo@@ ker will produce a high value of wave @-@ similar pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value matching the level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular step@@ width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral incre@@ ment width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral incre@@ ment size in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the duration . we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the save as and load buttons do exactly this . correc@@ ting any settings of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by clicking the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the voyage .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller bugs adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focus bar . this value sets the pixel gap that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is increased , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be altered and noise or s@@ me@@ ar occurs again .
edges : controlled the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more severely distorted , but also prescri@@ bes the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter cushi@@ oning . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected photo ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . use this tool to draw a soft sign with the menu item Con@@ duc@@ ting soft @-@ drawing and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right hand side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ akte Re@@ duce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards which are visible in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
the save as and load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ Restau@@ ration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Be@@ am button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera was recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected photo under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel from photos taken with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; light pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ room sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD dys@@ functions .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it back to the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all areas of view .
select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ ting is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters may need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which may cause the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filter and color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tor applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor filter and three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which causes an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tions reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers provide you with only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tions applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lens and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ der handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ne distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values magni@@ fy while positive image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values during the next start .
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or sizing changes . best result in this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton@@ ne correction the effect would be obvious to the fal@@ con .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to show the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form Con@@ tri@@ butions from the image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some images , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ne correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected photo under ( 2 ) to see .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for previ@@ ew@@ ing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter combines color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gran@@ ules on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ dient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the slider , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ined effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the difference .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filters carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon cap . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings shape your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter en@@ grav@@ ure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look like it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by clicking on the Be@@ ading button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ pen : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels to the centre . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera .
this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ hat : blur@@ red the image through random shifting of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
smart blur@@ ring : find the paint tank in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects will take a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time by clicking on the Be@@ ading button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
you can select with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ form Dre@@ aming or transforming mirrors menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you find out or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ ieren size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge image . &amp; digi@@ pack ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and listed below :
keep the aspect ratio unchanged : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used for this purpose . each recording for photo magni@@ fies as text file and can be loaded later .
infl@@ ate photo is very fast in what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Be@@ am button .
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) .The Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of linear enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can simply drag a new rect@@ angle by simply holding it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Edit button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview section , you can change the rect@@ angle size by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
this means that it always is the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches , or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the composition help make it possible to hide Help so that you can put together your pictures better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden mean is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the gold gradu@@ ation is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides more fluid lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the look of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates on this type a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that distra@@ cts the eye into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral above . its verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can be issued a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect called by professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ pack ; image processing and the tool to repair free rotation . choose transform@@ ieren free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with slide angle . the pres@@ ets on this slider are specified in degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side .
to your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ate Zu@@ trim from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture gets a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after adjusting the perspective you will get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal rotation for example will shift the top part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left .
rotate your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles . you can switch horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line will pop up . move the mouse to an important point like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two loops generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has ugly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ code ; shows only files in formats that know it . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed in the image processing . you can modify this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way in this way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clip is often used in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; use the settings to play movies to start playback .

many tools you need to make your photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ pa@@ .@@ Your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , noise reduction , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a unified dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture User @-@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left panel shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this box with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab offers an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ allets installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are stored in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color side@@ ways . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , editing , and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .
&amp; k@@ alli@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science .
the &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; shows graph with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; posters ; the graph newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate Stak@@ eholder
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . required are :
the main window displays the open graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the downloaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ alli@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; instance , or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can re @-@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph without head@@ line distributed on several pages and with another font
the Renew@@ t Shop page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
the Open page gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graph . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge cross@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ scheduled graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP algorithm creates a spring model layout for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the k@@ not circular in line with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms specific options , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ scheduled graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be shown if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further assistance to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Colour palette and the grid in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the symbol is to be created by a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
restore the last rever@@ sible step . if you don &apos;t have a step backwards , this feature is disabled .
add the cli@@ p@@ board content as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear in that you can replace the default duc@@ ting values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before using the button scan the image . the estimated file size will show you in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , otherwise some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button scan , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete working area to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of the program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog box displays options of the target image using the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can easily select the files to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for the convenient navigation . also , the Auto@@ Play option is available for the Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are invited to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other skills into the program . you can install as many modules as you like within the calling program .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management system . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are led through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to allow you to log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the knob controls should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos in a file selection box that you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the words field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as tags during upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the value of maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tudes are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog moves the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed on the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy . the map can be manually selected between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to facilitate the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . naturally , it also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . hit Canc@@ el to Canc@@ el the Process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started in order to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to look at a selection of images and on them perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture will be shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising , as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor has no documentation at this time . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG file . after that , you can start using Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the pictures you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
the next step is to specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG @-@ Output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button to the right below .
the print assist@@ ent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print out using the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ b by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from D@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file which should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image further .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently , or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sens . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . so use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ xel . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the missing images before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right side .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add to the list of images to be sent .
to remove images the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can click OK to open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send emails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after choosing comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are put together in a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the Menu Picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ odus data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is complete , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced slide show a window with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
between the pictures the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries are present .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current preview images .
if you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both people are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand images to some individual images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate preview image , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
in order to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . please note that you can select the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to open the image @-@ view window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also specify a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here is shown by pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but rather want to try the same function@@ alities , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog start the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo .
if you would rather like to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see part of a database by showing only 10 minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the preview pane view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual it is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , specify the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should be included later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . you can find detailed information about the export files in .
la@@ stly , you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . as a result , you can avoid that information is displayed , which are visible to the viewer without a description . note that all images are from a party .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all of your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check whether they really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the currently described settings have all three related to base @-@ folders or URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time signing up the picture information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you need to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of all images in the file is that you can have all the images together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files are searched .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if manually copy the .@@ k@@ im file to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to close the .@@ k@@ im file , copy and photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want to do so , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you choose a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called by your database . therefore , in the third dialog window you &apos;ll be asked what categories of the file to be imported and which categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . you can see an example of this in the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you see pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boy@@ friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured .
in this manual , you will learn the different steps from ( 1 ) Plac@@ ing the information about your images , ( 2 ) the search and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal security tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notices the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re@@ use them in future starts . if you would like to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings .
to the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. , for example , to set up all members of a group in a group instead of all groups of a member as stated in .
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shares its module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface .
the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures .
the applications that the modules over K@@ IP@@ I use together are very different , making it possible that some modules work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are releasing their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , we have to deliver a photo@@ album ; the modules also provide a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people , for example , will use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are not compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists using a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures , you can , by way of moving the names up , find and assign the persons more quickly .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon on the date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add them with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the thumb@@ nail image .
if you have received several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview . to show you that it is a hyper@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and drop it down to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the branches that form the top edge of the frame . you can also create your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... that offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then fade out the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures in case you have not set filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview section . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the removal button or select Clear in the Edit menu . now the window will show you what you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images even without you having stored on the hard disk . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then dup@@ licate them . so if you want to avoid irrit@@ ation , how to avoid mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end of the pictures you want to make accessible to others , and click the latest view block in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may view and lock the menu item Any@@ thing out of current view .
with this you have defined which pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock images , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other you can read or delete the password as an un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection only serves those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point . for this reason has &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the top of the image you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and drop it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with tro@@ mb@@ one and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image . you can use the mouse button to draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key the zoom places , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ al operations that work in videos work in and zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter those names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so if you have any images that you edit , print or whatever you &apos;ve selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be allowed &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your drawing later .
in order to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on On the picture from the pop @-@ up menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear , so that you can select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or reject the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L User Docum@@ entation to be able to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the properties pane and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a present view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to place multiple views on top of each other , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card leaders at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the p@@ asser to the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with window order view . it displays a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 actual . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering symbol in the tool@@ bar or ren@@ ame the menu item view Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
when you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you just want to render a small area of the image , select the check box sub @-@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the Quality of the combination you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixels with . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is repeatedly split up and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the adjacent pixel , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
abs = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually monitored and checked for further sub@@ division .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the Ra@@ ys around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha channel is to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; not yet the full range of commands by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type mark .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the objects displayed , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross the detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an expanded projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you tick the bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered rendered . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick the channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window Ord@@ in@@ ance section explains how to create and save window orders .
the standard window arrangement : shows all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window classi@@ fications display all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit item Edit . there@@ with you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button or press the button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body qu@@ acks ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited final level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the preview button you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . so always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities again , but take the simplest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and sphere in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree each time you choose one @-@ color and change the colors in the object &apos;s view :
you should already easily perform this step as you should have understood the basic way of working &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball will float above the bottom as you have shifted the floor to one unit down .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
once you have selected the ball , you can assign a material to it now . as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as colour :
select First Ob@@ jects and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select Regi@@ ons and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er offers . hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last rever@@ ted command . you can only select this menu item if you have used editing undo .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new short@@ com@@ s for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ boxes for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling tools using this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model every b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to a pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ hn show ; is a comfortable viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s , or the Return key .
you can set whether any picture should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ hn show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the remainder of the display area is filled with background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this item is activated , charges &amp; ku@@ hn show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still watching the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option , saves &amp; ku@@ hn show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; sp@@ h show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up so that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow will begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between the picture change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change here the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short@@ com@@ ings for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ pa@@ ed@@ ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements reported .
&amp; show@@ foto ; make it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains one entry reports you problems or desires . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work sequences as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ c@@ ached behavior . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to see in contrast . exposure should indicate a light color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or store the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel . cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview matches the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when you preview a preview in the settings before saving , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and shu@@ ffle ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before Save a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the kind of &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; images store . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded every time an image is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality that is used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Via starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite ; . the knob settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; c@@ ann@@ ite .
&amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; c@@ ann@@ l@@ ite is under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like any other short@@ cut short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set by right @-@ clicking on the player window and selecting Global Key short@@ cuts ... Select the player window with the right mouse button and select short@@ com@@ s ... Select .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this will make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of templates in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default script of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to show the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is allu@@ ded to . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to retrieve additional information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume displays a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script p@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can un@@ load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page by &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re also looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is right for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . additionally , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player .
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ des ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be fulfilled for them to be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the playlist , the player window will turn on or off the player window . if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ This option turns the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric Design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ This changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save voice files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ When this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started if a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; En@@ able this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist at the end of the playlist .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the play , causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is allu@@ ded .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Set@@ ting . using proprietary fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray section is activated . you can select scripts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the color selection activated by it for foreground and background color .
re@@ play at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display sub@@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can choose which screen of a multiple monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; Amar@@ ok should search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains cross @-@ check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load .@@ f@@ m card card addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can send the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send un@@ played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to send the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ teles@@ cop@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will provide for example trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by searching in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
it is mostly because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , turn off automatic when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but don &apos;t label them as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script sol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tags ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ ar@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ up : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ h@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ art &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are easiest to find through the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ zilla is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error if you have something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just an empty playlist will appear . how do you get into music ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the interface , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you &apos;ll find it under Tools Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist on the playlist and select column Display comment . you can also use the new review column to determine the rating for a piece . you can also use the short instruction Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it down , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist button is saved . click on it .
probably you lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is Wel@@ che Media types supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 deco@@ ders in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to use audio at the same time . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ ge ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . the En@@ large of Sound Buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less rever@@ t the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download F@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then , merge all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the add @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config file folder ) and execute the merge registry .
please report this under bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name also contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake from the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to learn the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running unit : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button sets a piece in the click order into the queue . by pressing the input button following a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search will be reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control panel ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and Edit : select Review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata edit metadata .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed schedule of publishing that does not match the short @-@ term planned schedule of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context browser design , click New Design to install ...
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .

if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please get the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and caused a lot of error reports .
suppose &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably use a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module has to be installed in the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ etic audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator record register . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up the settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output gives you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ di@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ r@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setting dialog , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we &apos;re sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . you can naturally take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can get the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the assistant , this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your One @-@ Click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch to the available analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set e@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the scroll bar to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 default settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display the e@@ quali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check@@ box , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section of this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also show cover images , which were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the given pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the pop @-@ up menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in each section to start playing immediately . you can right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the pop @-@ up menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the performer and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your tracks are displayed first by genre and among them according to the artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly beneath the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view and in the tree view . references to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there is a selection box under the search filter with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces from the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked by a name in which the list is to be stored .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for the transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section about the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the album is no longer listed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but again under the accompanying artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
you can also create created smart play@@ lists . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e. g. iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , find the pieces sorted on your iPod to interpreter in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
there is a search area under the tool@@ bar with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can retrieve music from a entered URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ c.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to app@@ end files by simply dropping files . in the event , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : thus dropping files are automatically added at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop them . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ clicking in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it includes buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left side you can add buttons that you can add to the playlist . right next to it , you can save play@@ lists , empty lists and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you &apos;ve shown in the player window through the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set tool@@ bars there .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all the pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eving is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , des@@ elect the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok by clicking this menu .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist appears next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces are played : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ ber ) . this mode requires that you already find some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with this dynamic playlist .
double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select store . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists mix instantly complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists are added with an empty playlist , and you must add at least one piece from your collection . the pieces you see will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .

played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , then add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists selected .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Con@@ figuration .

M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.@@ g MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code W@@ MA files to burn them onto an audio CD afterwards .
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed where you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you were to call saving for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and editing . you can also cancel the project and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for every un@@ saved project what to do with it , as if you have called for each project file close .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it , as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the upcoming dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the right mouse button .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s more useful for you to see the files and folders that already exist on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you later can burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy Dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a DVD image instead of a DVD , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burnt immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog box will typically help you to read a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view will contain an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , Lo@@ cking and Un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view includes open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this will open a dialog for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yp@@ ad assignment down below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality may be controlled by a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the two programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b has started . then type something like the following on the console :
besides general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; programs in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void Q@@ Valu@@ e@@ Li@@ st@@ lt ; ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Superior ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String Superior ) void Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it , easy to read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia interface ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that are encoding these WAV files ( loss@@ less compression ) default supported ( these enco@@ der packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if it is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed which are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer has a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protect the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be done once ( the setup dialog may be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble on in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the device &apos;s request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - when a enco@@ der has been configured in the Setup Settings tab - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the Setup dialog , the enco@@ der settings tab .
open the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure noti@@ fications ( such as logs , picks ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main direction dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ ders ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high audio quality ( for high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG , slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially in 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate app . 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or fet@@ ched automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title must be added to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that information can be downloaded / entered , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not of the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is meant by the author ) am not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ o @-@ ge@@ o is to be used at the nearest mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more about it , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution first if it hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are displayed on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ der . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , you can receive more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . you need to replace &apos; l@@ ame &apos; by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found using a search engine , since it is considered as not completely free software .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg , trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something that is likely to be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what for each reading &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing records of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card general settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be checked / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; Ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection box and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if this is worth it . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but as many fire@@ walls stack the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . to disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously absent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know it , so simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files are created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances you have to look right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo @-@ stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be dropped if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a du@@ al@@ core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just completed the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running on the disk . we will create and set MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos look a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b cut data . therefore , you will learn to input data manually , rather than picking them out of the internet . comments will point out the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then look in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and album is displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will appear , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - En@@ ter the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; in accordance with the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be di@@ vidu@@ ally used for the individual comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary range . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry , which obviously agrees with the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BO@@ M .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . make sure that all pieces are selected or press the button All items on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if the selection process has been started by clicking on the selection button , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the job tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error when trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . this is done by reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration option to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding .
now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial startup of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; located in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you want to add or change something useful , let him do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( L@@ ieder@@ texts or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
when you stop &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play button in the tool@@ bar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; playing a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text or text events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in sequence . in this section is how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize . click New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning of the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . keep in mind when you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic addition is enabled for the collection , automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . then the pieces will continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song , select the next song from the menu item or press the key arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button preceding piece , the previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transforms general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the type change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you just have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; The name of key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section speci@@ fies how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sound to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look as an example of the provided keyboard maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio pitch @-@ benefit events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , this is converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI Settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , Part MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to show the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the Point channel view : settings
tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use it . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , enable automatic setting of the collection to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I play a MIDI file ) or start playing a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file just quickly , without adding them to a collection , switch off automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , BA and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to write further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m currently studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really want to send me a joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only need to re@@ program@@ mer because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks is also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , bug notification or even a supporting email .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view images . you can also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends significantly on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the email lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and f@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , and to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Dur@@ able Play@@ list category .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; Current item &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , then select from the View menu and choose the next editing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML contents of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ long option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mp@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically stopped by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another tool for troubleshooting is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; console &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here , the output of mp@@ layer is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in set @-@ up dialog file assignments from K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a given back end for a specific mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually alter@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must be functional for the X server . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ 3 source .
are there critics like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play off from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why is it necessary to check my CPU for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is obsol@@ ete . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer will automatically need the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed in the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , you can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
if only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given here , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to handle &amp; lat@@ ex , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that defines the general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ node , the body starts with the command \ \ End { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command .
the quick entry wizard by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; proj@@ ectors &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is simply a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { order } ) , the command generates an empty line ( for example \ \ end { order } ) . this function can be set up in the menu box , and the La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most difficult and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the search search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI @-@ file &#91; device independent file &#93; was created &#93; , jump &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the original output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the click search , the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the default search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; file is jumped .
master document : this function is used to work with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is in this mode , and does not operate , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the first drop @-@ down box for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sche@@ dule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for the introduction of articles such as : keywords , key notes or references . the possibilities for custom@@ ization are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or another element .
reference : used for reference to a defined term ( choose a box possible ) .
when using quotation , a selection list with literary entran@@ ces is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e is used for determining the font size . you can specify the font sizes for the main text , the feet notes , etc .
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ document@@ node include the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu of the menu or the quick installation .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; the storage will automatically exp@@ ire .
if the document comp@@ iles fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging . if it is used by Quick Building , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written text is created 12 and only a couple of columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the change of the font size within the environment .
the changes are covered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many options to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . it can be added , for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the ital@@ ics and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or other environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . for this , a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . the window must be closed to an external viewer .
once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is a device @-@ independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI @-@ file into other formats . once the DVI @-@ file is made from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in changed other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows direct jump from editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , just set up Modern in Settings box ... Tools build up .
to complete the pre@@ fix search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on thumb@@ nail search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error in using Quick Building der &amp; DVI ( viewers ) , there may be a mistake . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the Log@@ ging File then displays the error source in the source code . in the editor , then the bugs trig@@ gering La@@ Te@@ X errors and the latest La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for errors between errors . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the fla@@ wed line .
once the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must open or create a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting a file template from document ...
when creating a new document using a new document , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General are set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used like this : \ \ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; boxes ; used as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to experience its options , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference guide . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with the C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means clicking on \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ .@@ it is only \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a twisted Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jumping tok@@ ens . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries Edit Dra@@ wings or the corresponding button select the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also highlights this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a drawing .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent options , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex . &amp; lat@@ ex ; always require many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for selecting them are included :
contains a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also called &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a scroll line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by clicking the Del key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit surroundings for a more easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , skip to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a number of ne@@ sted ambient orders , the overview of the environment can be lost quickly . this command will close the last open environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups intended by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environments .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right before the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the consec@@ u@@ sive locked bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the shiel@@ ded clamp a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many oc@@ tag@@ onal groups braces , the overview may be lost fast . this command will close the last open group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used in &amp; box ; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; character &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used for two simple quotes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. , n@@ german or french ) , so that German or French can be used . there are also many other languages available .
when holding Shift ; input key for &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete &amp; Ki@@ le within one table environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set among settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t character ( amp ; ) among each other . if this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the one that is associated , add &amp; box ; add some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source of source code , this was added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still extended . there are three different modes built @-@ in . all these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
when beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when you click the click button , the last character of the input will be removed and may be de@@ cryp@@ ted by the full list . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing ski@@ pping brands N@@ Ã ¤ br@@ ste jumping tag , and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; all settings can be made to these lists . there can be different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ pers of general language use .
command mode is not necessary for complete environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the full @-@ time environment will result . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for rever@@ ber@@ ating environments .
when calling the full @-@ time environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment will be automatically m@@ apped and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient exp@@ ir@@ ation can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once and Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the wi@@ per list of full @-@ time support mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of cancell@@ ations that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word processor mode is introduced over the editing process or the C@@ TR@@ L + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete registration for all already written requests .
this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled . here , also the threshold value for the display of the complete control can be specified .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creates graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to see the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the building tools are grouped in group mode in the creation , creation , and creation view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for the viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard , Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI @-@ file can be viewed in the default viewer by means of old ; 3 by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be added to the Project New Project .... This includes the following information for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ led@@ r project file .
the script function by &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , containing a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important pack@@ ets are described ) but is ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; supplied , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the to &amp; box ; supplied documents and a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or stroke extensions . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project asp@@ ire and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we can all use with respect to the &amp; GNU ; you can find up @-@ to @-@ date information on contribut@@ ors in the Help &amp; Ki@@ le menu .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use Kom@@ mander as interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we raise it yet another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer depends on a terminal ; just click on the symbol for the XML processor and get ready !
this application requires a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in a war@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already mentioned , everyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the open file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply let the current working folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
is the file to be reviewed already in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; , then let the current file simply be checked . if not , delete the check file in the current file and select the file to be reviewed by using another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ stly , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this allows the plug @-@ in system to benefit instantly and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start editing plug @-@ in editing . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Di@@ alogue events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
input notes is simple . it can either be chosen from the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed .
large / lower case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
sp@@ elling of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatically replacing acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by using button standard , the default settings can be recovered .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or in other way as a file open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting , however , is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is eliminated by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a file carrier ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the default window settings back to default when the user interface has come across by changing M@@ DI mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cking / det@@ aching views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the location to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source pane view in the shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons .
in the field of structure tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty spaces are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ ler abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plu@@ gins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; download component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses the load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the information entered is correct , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ ber@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . normally appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plugin with , listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally not care must be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gging session Start the session . close the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ate listening to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing information about the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , but if possible in functions and include it will be corrected .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the directive and proceed to the next as if there is no current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find at ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities like car completion and knot@@ ting . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar . Tag folder contain two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented buttons of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tions@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that coll@@ ates the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , only checking the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is currently being checked .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for editing a &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = head@@ land 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D directive . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . clicking New action leads to the same dialog :
the button abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking the user &apos;s button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; self are the Schnell@@ start -@@ Dialog , or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scripts / scripts / scripts / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There is other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : is sub@@ stituted with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is attached to the PID @-@ number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can accept inputs from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; input can be specified in the input field , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed accordingly . there are two types of output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard edition by setting the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all the fields you need and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , enable dialog &quot; edit day &quot; when available to allow input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we &apos;ll use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel as default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is going to be included ; tag ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , if any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog via Settings tool bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by checking all the symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if anyone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the document HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top Element = your description for these files e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and , consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace does not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which serves to shape the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation should be displayed directly for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of comm@@ a @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified them in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anywhere else . in different places there is an email with an email , like DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . we recommend that the contributions are verified and only available if our team needs them as correct and beneficial for the publication . to make a positive contribution , we recommend to sign the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your personal G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the New Resource exchange , the input fields must be filled in ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree menu .
after downloading a resource , before installation , insp@@ ected &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears indicating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creating can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and DT@@ D Con@@ vert menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
a type definition string : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and fully benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; available . from tool@@ bars about actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions designed specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ g@@ gles the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main sections : the editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with info and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , other or all file riders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marking or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click edi@@ ts in the editor area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , or opening the file , when the string under the mouse poin@@ ter den@@ otes a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the symbol that represents the day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the building man@@ si@@ ties ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and ro@@ am . in the representation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system , which is aligned to the content , allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two dec@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in front of its bin folder .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; html @-@ editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE ; to be .
now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why developing what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ made actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost every task . by the program Kom@@ mander , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being removed .
this allows you to save code pieces and entire files as templates for later use . if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are a special character to the &amp; html ; -@@ Description , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ eme , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
to@@ g@@ gles the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script causes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
initial and turning of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the icon column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project management . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be added by settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by means of tool bar is denied if this day is contradic@@ ting the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an enabled plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ as depends on the grades ; -@@ Version .
sel@@ ects the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; ti@@ dy with the remote application .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended by flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that matches the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window . selecting a single entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
switches the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
direc@@ ts the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e &apos;s behaviour . in the documentation of &amp; posters ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled in .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without whit@@ esp@@ ace with the extension web@@ in@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except for processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if there are files somewhere in the main folder of the project , let &apos;s get involved . if a project is started anew from scratch , don &apos;t hook into it .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can select a precise selection according to Gut@@ enberg .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or modified with Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) that are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view of the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pl@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically stored . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are the same , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button context menu :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can create many high @-@ loading profiles so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . during editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slave . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is hidden on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; preferably st@@ ack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . use and Add differ . adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the Ad@@ ding tool bar section .
the tool bar and the icons can be inserted either via context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , can be executed other actions such as tool bar , ren@@ ame tool bar , or set tool bars to be displayed , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and Settings dialog . set .
templates are basically a document skel@@ eton , code escal@@ opes and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a basic file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you submit to the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents by means of short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on templates .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate save as Local Tem@@ plate ...
once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate save choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can use all file management functions for it , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files tree view can be cli@@ cked to a folder on the right and select site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can provide head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically integrate with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of container as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this option is bl@@ ended as soon as el@@ der@@ ial attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular staff in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows a written text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate header lines / foot@@ ers through copying of content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ous . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source code editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . if you choose from V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ isation by one click or automatically . in principle , the time period can be adjusted automatically . basically , the recommendation is : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
it is assumed that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the tag encoding .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , for example , keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor can be used like in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the cur@@ sor functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing keys or deleted using a back button or a ran@@ gle .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool bar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wizard or the list assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists have to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style templates , the search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to be able to compile and compile successfully , you need the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , wai@@ ste retention points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following input is possible :
this command will rever@@ t to a partial or complete agreement with a default named QNA@@ P@@ or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ name that contains the string template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after stop must be resolved for the respective UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stop points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

if a value is specified for the search@@ result sp@@ ath option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , search@@ result .x@@ ml is edited by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , using the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html &quot; search@@ able ht@@ m@@ l@@ .x@@ s@@ l .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ result .x@@ ml is created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template to show the data in another form , if the option &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; is not set , search@@ .@@ txt file is displayed .
depending on the amount of data to be processed , execution of this command can take some time .

on systems with an installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll down the arrow keys to / from the commands that have been executed so far .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound words as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a stop is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small nightmare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added later .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you when comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anger if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by just writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ Diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 3 folder 2 Fol@@ der 3 folder
opening dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . however , if a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also handle this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting comparing / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d only have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C associated . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected you see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are checked , the line is represented on a broken line .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Modi@@ fy &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatic merging already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find the remaining resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the batch by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in case you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and place somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , see how you are used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . by inser@@ ting button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the section together and the edi@@ table output window is explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / first difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up@@ side / C@@ tr@@ l picture wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the flag to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you select , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy it . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the cli@@ p@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line extension \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also places fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen script does not support this presentation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ast@@ er@@ ased . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically introduces an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board , and manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , you will find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive after even minor differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic @-@ jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued .
automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning the folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation for inventory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is set global by the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the encoding speci@@ fies a short notice , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
disable this to supp@@ ress up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this option is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
assign the comparison windows to each other or overl@@ apping each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command will only be used for line intervals . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this command to convert new@@ lines to upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another processing command for line ab@@ uses . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . for example :
per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ft@@ . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ft / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line ab@@ user al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line matching pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without really carrying them out ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , do not merge . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you browse the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
every file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually worked together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the name of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even though the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is green only green , then yellow becomes red and later when it &apos;s old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then research &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , merging the folder cannot be started .
while merging , one file is processed after another . you status column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ dingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok all over .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all matching actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as a destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as the destination and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all the entries : select / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry : select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ges actions , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options through Exec@@ ute , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( notice the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select / resume directory management again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you commit the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been individually merged , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be shown again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be viewed as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Fol@@ der @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the main advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point will mark a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether to display these files in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic link@@ ages are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is turned off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is turned on , the links will result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( type a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it might be quicker to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the familiar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are the same size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modified date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without any further backup .
normally , the folder merge command remains visible while merging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option list &amp; text window to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you may prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new .
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , they are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # will have the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link appears to a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ tion of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part to view from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist from the patch file . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will start to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file is created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ lies ) exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by taking a look at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical . if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this is the case this is the case .
the editor takes notice of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly fl@@ ushed ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 basic sub@@ folder ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir indicates the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with compile . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ des ; -@@ mailing lists of this .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ o@@ ving ) Copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders are not in folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after making changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function . )
this also causes identical files when merging aren &apos;t copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C inscription below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . down@@ times in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , end them or move them . this works in both a working area and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up P@@ ager . if cli@@ cked , the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries will be minim@@ ized , maxim@@ ising , working area and exit .
maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from P@@ ager applications are known in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work surfaces in a vertical row , which is very well suited for display on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set @-@ up sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; you can read a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a drop @-@ down window .
in default scale &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( drop window mode ) or the area of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg . on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the window is fixed and only the lower right corner is moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store it in a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the rate of updating , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sm@@ aller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a screen area to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual disabled .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / K@@ mag ( either type this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; has been developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ er@@ s.@@ s@@ f.@@ net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter holds a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the mouse might also cause pain . if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and results in a mouse click as soon as you break the motion .
if the smart shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulated the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if intel@@ li@@ gible shift is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is down , wait before the mouse button starts again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse @-@ shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kel@@ .@@ txt , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound Buff@@ ers you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response time .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de . please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window promp@@ ts to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the user &apos;s last push .
the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that do not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse moves , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse over mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be left by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you are using &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . as a result , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to copy text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it instead : execute a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . as a result , every time , when and m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent move starts . later you can use the intelligent shifting without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you need to install the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X @-@ Window . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor falls short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those who use the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; was developed by Gun@@ n@@ ar Sch@@ mi D@@ t Gun@@ n@@ ar @ schm@@ i @-@ d@@ t@@ .de , Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Jeff Rous@@ se Jeff @ m@@ ous@@ eto@@ ol@@ .com .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets silent users talk to their computers for themselves .
with program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation history to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) you enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the set @-@ up dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . you can select text passages from the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third side ( right screen shot ) you determine the vocabulary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have mounted k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the tra@@ iling memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page vocabulary and K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the flash@@ card language edition , type the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
try to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service , first try to share the text with the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pas@@ sage@@ book or in the bar for text pas@@ sports books .
with the selection of instant phrases , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and inserted in addition to the memory storage . the selected text passage is then entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can decide whether the text pas@@ se should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book by selecting text pas@@ sage@@ ways . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book is not saved . select Before you request to save , it will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text book is to be saved .
the page vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new inserted words automatically insert into the dictionary , in the course of time , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text pas@@ sage@@ directories are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you selected a text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can only change its name .
adding actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or pull @-@ down menu .
the order of text pas@@ sports books or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly beneath the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow margin in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable body for text pas@@ sage@@ books is displayed with entries . the bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output right or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; Set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the flash@@ cards speech output . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ sing are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and to carry on without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written voice generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ak folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator is activated only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to adjust , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use and mouth , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can send text through the computer . there is a list of already spoken pro@@ positions that the user can always re @-@ publish .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on your computer .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
reading text ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
the speech output is performed via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) using the command line .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you can use speech tools , you must install speech @-@ speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set it correctly .
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General will be shown .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker is shown . this appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the flash@@ card General and check if enabled voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text messages .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . once this start is successful , the card card is displayed and you can create and read text orders .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the voice output field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the control bar while reading , it disappears once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and resume text orders .
buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card card orders only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text which should be read and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text which should be read and select Tools text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events that you have defined . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
supported a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy are different depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which comes to the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as assumed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are edited before it is sent to the speech speech tool . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , in order to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of filters it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of the screen readers is read , the ordered orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issue of the warning .
news has the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can see &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you use from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reads , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
text boxes replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string inser@@ tion filters , which facilitate the substitution of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form possible .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , he continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters created . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
to set up character encoding filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list of a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the character encoding filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character encoding filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s \ \ s \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alogs Add or Edit .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such modifications .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify texts from k@@ mail to be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filters , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the spokesperson for the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of speakers established on the card card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this one by clicking on the button to get help in entering .
to get a faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which is best suited to the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the dialog speaker selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text when all the conditions with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter box apply when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give T@@ TS capability to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which uses the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the above synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ format filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Cau@@ ght @-@ Wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be corrected by a string release filter . see .

the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it here . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of c@@ deco@@ ding under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with every language synthes@@ izer , which can be run on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages listed above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the Synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages .
the speech synthes@@ izer &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ art ; to use another synthes@@ izer , please contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program .
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for c@@ un@@ ning or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into single sentences . the user can return set or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or break the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; hands @-@ over , it may request the properties of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , look for .
when you click on the Add @-@ on tab , and in order to insert a speaker into the list , or click Edit , the box @-@ card speaker system will be shown . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to type festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices that are known , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slide controls allow you to adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controllers and display them gray , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected when starting kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here , all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or return on the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . output of screen readers , aler@@ ts and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the types of message by &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ .@@ % about double normal speaking speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
on this card card , you can set up specific actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . once the output of the screen readers has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; however , greet someone who just steps into the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to be able to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications appear .
mark this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read aler@@ ts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played is not read by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the list of speakers as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All Noti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the Noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , voice and pitch . furthermore , SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used for the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ g ; % , SS@@ ML is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster to start reading because only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the stat@@ ute border detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set border recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add further set boundaries recognition filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn the choice of subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . turn off the subscri@@ ber selection and select text for reading . check on the card menu assignments , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select . turn off the speaker selection , change some features and check how the choice of the speaker is changed .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then hold or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set boundaries recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal sentence del@@ ine@@ ation filter by mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card menu subscri@@ ber selection you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the speaker card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the original settings .
select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may wish to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr cuts immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get any trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashing and &amp; kt@@ ts ; was finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , you may install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
in your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the card audio there is an adjustment speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer an adjustment for speed on the flash@@ card for speaking devices . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the speed settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML envelope filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to change SS@@ ML . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a custom label translation filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the track record orders will be shown , the order will only consist of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by invo@@ king the G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the follow @-@ register command . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ teles@@ cop@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also includes , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install apt @-@ get install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
if you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least built on request .
the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the rules of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option column shows the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation .
the default setting is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ bug echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you would like to let websites be read , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to set the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language translation system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found at .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the file festival / lib / . instructions can be found at
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the playing of error correc@@ tions is not necessary , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu ke@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the Network Set@@ ting module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of network properties possible .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices in installing &amp; Linux will be installed , installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . by marking the setting non @-@ recurring requests , the setting can be made permanently .
changing network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can be viewed only , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Interface :
the settings on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to be edited in the dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are made from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further setting is required . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask field , the sub@@ net mask must be determined .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . turning an off @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface ...
defines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution computer part of the list name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added to the priority list by selecting an entry and descending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... it will display the Edit dialog .
the list named above describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the familiar host has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of a named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the list and select Edit ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately implemented in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other functions .
this is recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files will be discussed .
in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread use . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that provides a valid IP address or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
in this section are the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is no other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected may therefore occur .

to cut a variable , first select the variable to remove . then go to edit .
to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to editing .
alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first one must be cut out or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then the option inser@@ tion is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit .
to change a variable , first select the variable to be working . then go to Edit Change ... alternatively , you can right @-@ click the variable and change ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . then the dialog appears to edit variables in which , as described above , you can edit the variable .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select them , and specify the state with the Edit menu item . when a variable is de@@ activated , it appears under description De@@ activation .
alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select activating . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or modified , you still have to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select the File menu item .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables only become active .
it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user &apos;s schedules .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar which furthermore provided dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar &apos;s ability for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; C@@ dat ; do the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognize the tape on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat ; the pre@@ fix , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting by &amp; k@@ dat ; it requires a tape to be format@@ ted before using . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile are backed up .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
once you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ box has been started , the dialog box appears for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before re@@ producing , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog box will appear to restore . in this dialog , you can even check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will restore . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files contained in the same file system are stored in the same file system as the folder . folders resi@@ ding on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered from tar independent of the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection to the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the band is ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ y block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape .
the tape @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be directly administr@@ ated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open it . if you don &apos;t have a small message window , you will probably not have started with system administrator privileges .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or after entered strings . in the default setting , the selection box next to the Filter contains the entry All . then , a protocol line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , select the name of a process in the protocol file System Prot@@ o@@ oll , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , and show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the step error are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol @-@ line of the step indicator . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only specific processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the To New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the new log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named as so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for checking the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone could attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re @-@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . so you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to run when switching the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , that is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from your hand and change the 3 . if you want to run a bit , then come back to re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running levels or move the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new section . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , running level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cli@@ pping into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the required run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly running . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end off without a message if their configuration files are not present or set in@@ correctly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have extended system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created , on which you can make individual settings . more card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card card appears , if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation .
the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ arian Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group Di@@ alogue features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or Del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
