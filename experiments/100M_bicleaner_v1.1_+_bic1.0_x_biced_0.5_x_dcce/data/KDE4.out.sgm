<seg id="1">The module website can be translated in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list the output and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated instead of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. in the best case, Babylonfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made depending on the translation without first checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can insert texts into translation directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; select settings extensions... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde; addons. please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that & konqueror contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools Abcrashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also known as the folder filter) is available in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras view filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different types.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM from the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentnode, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists of representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower object objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView; the size of a file or folder is the size of a file or folder. this way, large files can be easily detected, even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View colour mode, can either represent depth for the easy recognition of the merge depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area should be used by subordinate rectangles. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap in & FSView the rule should be complied with. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. it is drawn frames to indicate the nesting of entries, and this framework needs space, which is then not available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoidance of space losses by frame to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View menu item. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras photo gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to set up the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the gallery page title in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the image file name of the image indicate whether the file names are displayed in the gallery below the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">When viewing the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you can determine if the size of the pictures is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the file selection" "" "Save in HTML" "" "file, specify where to save the HTML page." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">When connecting subfolders with the check box, you can set the subfolder to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the original images check box, you can determine if the original images are to be copied into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment text check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">You can set a different color depth for the thumbnails in the check box as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings allows you easy access to the general & html settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & html settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media reproduction for the navigation area in the & konqueror; View menu in the navigation area or using the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; add to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for certain domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the MSIE code for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & html; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module you will check your & CSS; style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the website's website in the & konqueror; check-out menu under Extras website. you can make the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; Verification test whether your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this check, you can make sure that your pages are correctly displayed by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style templates embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document included. with valid & CSS, your websites have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site to redirects and erroneous shortcuts. all the links on the website are recursively checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & html; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web Archiving for & konqueror; you can save websites with text and images in .format format.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "click" "" "Archive" "" "with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web Archiving is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik mupbch @ iam.unibe.ch - ossa @ kde.org painter @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digipack; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digipack; easy to use, there are dozens of professional skills available. it works completely in 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also a digipack; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digipack; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides an entry problems or requests.... This will open a dialogue with a signed link. if you are using this link, your web browser will open a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to invite you to other users of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipaedia; visit homepage for news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get involved is to register in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digicode; first start, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicode; will also be used as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the uppermost folder that contains pictures as a base folder. & digicode; looks at every subfolder as an album.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicode; During recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is hidden in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera in & digikam. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it may be possible to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu aid menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in Roh DecoderSettings and Roh procedures sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is then used as a USB mass storage device. it can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digipack; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever-increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicode; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so the preview images of digikam can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may see thumbnails, or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digipah; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam; to provide KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function, when the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and holding images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal separation line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture can not be dropped in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to make the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter will only be used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter will work on the filename only if it is shown in the symbol view.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, by the name of their collection in the Albenites or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose Album Imported images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. you can move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select the album properties menu in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete albums after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Elders' buttons, average, new testers: these set the date on the oldest, the most recent image or the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first select an album in & digipack; open, the first picture is selected in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select the right mouse button in the context menu & quot; Set as album preview. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digipack; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection includes always all photos of the album.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the preview images are generated. you can avoid using this in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information these are, you can change the digicode settings; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons, which appear when you leave the mouse pointer at a moment above a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the words of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all what the digipack is all about. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... Select. image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos. image editing can be used to view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking and selecting the program from the File Type submenu.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs can result in problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicode; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right-click the preview and select shoot. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the thumbnail and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digipack; delete it, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Photo Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can therefore also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the tags are re-imported at the loss of the database as soon as & digikam; the pictures noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keywords'; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you click on an existing keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this becomes the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "you can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot;" "" "My keywords" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select the pop-up preview in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To handle the functionality with keywords, you must first have your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can right-click on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words assigned to it. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the context menu of the photo and select from the context menu Remove. the menu will show you only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a chronologically adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the box, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Nebend he search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found nothing, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your choice, press OK and the search is performed. the Find list view is used to assign a name to My Search List. if you want to change your selection after search again, select only the appropriate entry from the View My Search List and select an option in its pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit a search, the search will appear with the search information previously entered. if you select as advanced search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select the Search button in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. any option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it. each option can be linked to others by the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitizer; characterizes any image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: draw-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digipack; find the matching pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab offers an intuitive search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally presupposes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digipack; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem luminaire from the pop-up menu. the selection will be added to the lighted table and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview panel you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window and drop it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to sort out quickly from a series of images. if you browse combination mode from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. the picture shown on the right is displayed in the right pane. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal fire actions also work directly out of the luminaire like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the luminaire. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can recognize along the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you have to click them and hold the & LMB. in the preview mode, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions as well as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to secure, find, protect and use your images. we will focus on the process for digital photographers the & digipack; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing up, searching, archiving, archiving, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data via data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data, information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to find a particular photo without stock management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digipack;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; Note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were able to organize several times in the same place. if you do enough photos, you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in the editing page of the metadata in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data is written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want to change? to do this, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now choose any picture of words, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or categories continue. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam will automatically build the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very crude representation as each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most of you just see your photos, they want to share it with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motif that moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitizer; you can save as much text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the labeling and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? wasn't it Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the move of the spatial presentation is now already with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will be even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using imagery with geographic information. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can use with GoogleEarth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked with the author. this field contains the photographer's work description. examples can be titles such as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or Independent Commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machine can delete or change this image embedded in the image. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digipaed; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate failures, plate loss, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread Aberdeen</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even with traditional paper snapshots or negatives. in this section you'll find problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you are just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray Disc can store 50 GB and almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recorder to high-quality media in a non-propriesent format. after that, read the data to check for you. likewise, you must copy the media with a description, date & author and then transfer them to a clean, dark dry and safe environment.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's assorations cover a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives to this subject: floppy error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In a nutshell: disks hold the longest if you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in the case of lower temperature tours, the error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART fail to notice the imminent failure. this is especially reading ehler and shift counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical appliances do not make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause serious damage, loss of hardware, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and creates the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it fulfils the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers offer overvoltage shutter that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a non-stop power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and run down the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current troubles with cost avoidance. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV you can get for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can integrate it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & Dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & Dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are provided on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution Online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies include a backup and a distributed storage in the offer. thus, they are disaster-safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says to you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. please read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms as the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at workplace systems. notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most thinkers think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are going towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to worsen. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">So make no one responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. therefore, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as installing your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will have you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane spending: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence disaster prevention always means no local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another benefit of the physical separation: as said above, a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts only rsync copies the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, retained XMP files, retain original memory, scalability, media, recover images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to be careful and re-evaluate all that is told today. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and want to increase the area you want to increase on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBI; # works with ext3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of a fanned if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can save gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (delate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardize camera output formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope to use both Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xlsquot; that stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera media, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archives. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images back with the digipack; edit, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digipack; to get. in the Adding a Photos to an album you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digipack; to use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it off. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is established, a final indicator appears at the lower end and the preview images of all photos on the camera are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Tabs metadata tells the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the Metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button to download and then download all of them. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then select the selected. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are downloading the buttons or download the selected ones, a dialog appears where you can select the target album where the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digipack; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at one time by deleting the Delete button. if you only want to delete some, you must first select it and delete the selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos were downloaded successfully in a & digipack; -album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should do so via the camera system because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options, which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%%% H:% M:% S in the edit field. turn off the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digicode; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicode; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digitizer; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced Edit button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it is stored & digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced Settings button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button download. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is finished, asked & digitized; you see where the pictures are to be uploaded. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this means a position indicated in latitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be identified by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map out an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digipack; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailer and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in gpx format because this is the only format supported by the geo mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the primitive signs of hairy coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you so much control over its work sequences as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to change the Settings menu. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or Image Processing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the respective IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should include names such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description to the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate who works the photo. this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not just in the & digipack database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cursor hangs over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicode; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digipack; to indicate which file types & digipack; to indicate which file types & digikam will attempt, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "the default settings can be reset again by clicking the" "" "Update" "" "button on the right of each category." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digicode; can be set to the default values on this page. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, you can only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma Subsample means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please refer to this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF file option compresses the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws the image slightly soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the sharpness. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned into the settings, because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digipack; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Restore option, you will get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the digipack; editing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of partial raw data that comes from the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and that a matrix of color pixels is available.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicode; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, since it is carried out during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from a color space to the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Issues when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folders Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard source; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colourless not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma isn't corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options such as the Soft Proof profile, which you can emulate on how to recover your image from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them for what. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plug-in interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by delivering this interface, & digicode; many modules written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digipack; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.tipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch off the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties on the left side provide a list of all cameras currently supported. on the right side there is a button Automatic Identification that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera bar. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digipack; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check whether & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's menu. if you own more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving images in the trash, you can set the conversation of & digikam; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find further details when you delete a photo and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digikam; applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without queries. otherwise, you must save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see the display of the welcome screen from & digikam; stopping when starting. this speeds up the start-up of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start for new photos is forcing & digikam; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, asked & digiticame; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & digipack; used to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected among Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These themes have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digipack; to create, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digipack; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the View / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the upper edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save file or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button or the button "Restore Image Editing" button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any image processing action can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by editing undo or recovering by selecting Edit restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z for undo and remember Ctrl; -switching Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB above the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in-between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you get to the normal view where you are using the Esc key. if you do not want to do so, you can change it in the editing dialog by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the picture in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exporting Print Assist. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitizer; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab to let the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view you can insert or insert captions with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata to the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree, and a box with the keywords applied earlier in this & digipack; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword in question. you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they will be stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are saved to the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a keyword with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply draw it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to bet the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on Keine keyword, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree has been selected and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Variables.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image issues are via email or web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why use a different color space and thus have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then About About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB outputs the circle. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you either need to callibrate your monitor, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any more manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, balance, automatic synchronization and contrast extend from the menu Conducting Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparison: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes, the balance generates very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic levelling: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histograms range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a reorganization of all values in-between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochnym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">This histogram is very useful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow Justification lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The save as and load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed picture. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of blanks. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consulted by the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always makes the same mistake and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in the colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The colour effects are provided by four colour effects, a solarisation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when one partially developed a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approximately 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase ultimately creates a negative image that so does not produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it deals the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid Filter simulates the so-called Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colour film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments you can look at in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool sound value correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog appears to be very complicated for this tool, you need only the area of the slider for the application explained here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three slide bars are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be previewed on the right. the preview will be updated dynamically using the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this drop-down box can be set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the mid frequencies, often called gamma ratings.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpoints can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a full automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a light picture as a background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button sets the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified Channel: this drop-down box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of the most sensible. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a short arrow to the right, for example the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with darker markings and that the accompanying image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is shown on the preview of the original photo. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipettes buttons, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you are not found in more than one channel, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the LuminanzCanal. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digipack channel mixer; Image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Select the color for the histogram with the channel selection box: this gives you a first indication how you can adjust the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel blender will then be THE tool to generate great black and white conversions to your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used for precisely this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. the option Luminanz must be preserved. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar light at the time of the day. similar to the 003 cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithaton: generates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and the re-development in a squier. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sampafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">By using the & digipack; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digipack; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bending it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any point. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text display, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digipack; apply tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu template template uses in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to diminish the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil template, just send an e-mail in english to the & digikam; mailingliste digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for first time, you need to set your template folder with the button's base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template bar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob magnifies the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. just take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image sharper. in fact, it sharpens a bit, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process can be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in blurred edges. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images are often used for camera internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already during reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo by sharpening the focus. you can call this with the menu item Conducting Schärding.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should handle this carefully because the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for a soft sign with the menu item Conducting soft-drawing and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right hand side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and impression of grenades are produced near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpest pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. this sets the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from the sharper and thus avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2).</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digipack; tool refocused refocused an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted depletion filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image & quot; refocused "quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will continue to smear the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most often caused by a previously executed blurred filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used for exactly this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to complete all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave later unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as a JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the unsharp masks a larger neighbourhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening the field of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider sets the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinplate allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details preserve p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is subsequently necessary. please note that the detail preservation should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD smoker will produce a high value of wave-similar pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching the level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulb effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular stepwidth since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral increment width [0,1, 10]: integral increment size in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the duration. we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The save as and load buttons do exactly this. correcting any settings of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by clicking the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the voyage.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digipack; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focus bar. this value sets the pixel gap that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is increased, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be altered and noise or smear occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more severely distorted, but also prescribes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter cushioning. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected photo (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier to sharpen than a picture. use this tool to draw a soft sign with the menu item Conducting soft-drawing and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right hand side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digipack; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film baskets, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte Reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifacts & quot; - small standards which are visible in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The save as and load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-Restauration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Beam button.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera was recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected photo under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel from photos taken with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and 'quot; light pixel quot; on a photo with a darkroom subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">The tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it back to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic corners (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digipack; vignetting correcting is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters may need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may cause the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filter and color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting corrector applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignetting corrector filter and three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which causes an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting corrections reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers provide you with only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digipack; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting corrections applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a lens and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitized; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grader handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the removed corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonne distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values magnify while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values during the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or sizing changes. best result in this correction as the first one. if you re-cut an image and then perform a tonne correction the effect would be obvious to the falcon.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to show the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Transform Contributions from the image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some images, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected photo under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for previewing. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add movie granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter combines color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digipack; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film granules on your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gradient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, grainy look especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the slider, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grained effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digipack; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digipack; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smoothing controls smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the difference.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digipack; filters carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon cap. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digipack; filter engravings shape your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engravure is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look like it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analog to wave-blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time by clicking on the Beading button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpen: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels to the centre. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographed from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">This creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelhat: blurred the image through random shifting of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: find the paint tank in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects will take a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time by clicking on the Beading button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can select with the & digipack; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">The original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it to the right orientation by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the Transform Dreaming or transforming mirrors menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you find out or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformieren size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge image. & digipack; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio unchanged: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulb effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. each recording for photo magnifies as text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflate photo is very fast in what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Beam button.</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3) .The Preview (2) is the result of linear enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. you can simply drag a new rectangle by simply holding it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Edit button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the rectangle size by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in high-format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it always is the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches, or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition help make it possible to hide Help so that you can put together your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden mean is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The gold graduation is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more fluid lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the look of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates on this type a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that distracts the eye into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the gold spiral above. its vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals to place these lines can be issued a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect called by professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the digipack; image processing and the tool to repair free rotation. choose transformieren free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with slide angle. the presets on this slider are specified in degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function Transformate Zutrim from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatically cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is displayed in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture gets a little blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After adjusting the perspective you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal rotation for example will shift the top part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles. you can switch horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line will pop up. move the mouse to an important point like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two loops generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has ugly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicode; shows only files in formats that know it. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is displayed in the image processing. you can modify this list of file extensions that & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digipack; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way in this way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the shell image format, please refer to Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to make your photo editing are included in & digipa.Your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softening, noise reduction, refocus, blurring, & etc;. use a unified dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; texture User-quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kalliviewer; is a & kde; program which requires the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. required are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graph, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kalliviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the downloaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item Settings kalliviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a Graphite file outside a running & kgraphic viewer; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kalliviewer; instance, or display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can re-open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; -algorithm is the standard for unscheduled graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP algorithm creates a spring model layout for unerized graphene. it uses the Fruitman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-lattice for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm orders the knot circular in line with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give the & graphviz; -algorithms specific options, or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. at present, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear in that you can replace the default ducting values to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before using the button scan the image. the estimated file size will show you in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, otherwise some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan, you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore produces very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management system. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Exporting to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are led through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started to allow you to log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking on Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The knob controls should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos in a file selection box that you want to upload. if you click on the Ok button the upload of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The words field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as tags during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. size is taken from the value of maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF data of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitudes are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done using the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpoling and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog moves the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed on the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy. the map can be manually selected between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to facilitate the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. naturally, it also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. hit Cancel to Cancel the Process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started in order to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to look at a selection of images and on them perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture will be shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising, as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor has no documentation at this time. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG file. after that, you can start using Tools MPEG Diaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">The next step is to specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG-Output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistent allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gip. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print out using the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcrab by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from Dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file which should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image further.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently, or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsens. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. so use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can scale or enlarge the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo apixel. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the missing images before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will appear on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">To remove images the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can click OK to open the New message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After choosing comments in an attached file, the comments on the images are put together in a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Menu Picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exodus data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is complete, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, searching for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced slide show a window with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. by chance, each transition between the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images displayed on which both people are visible. through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand images to some individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a separate preview image, this also applies to locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. please note that you can select the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you will need to open the image-view window (in closer description) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also specify a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here is shown by pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading manuals, but rather want to try the same functionalities, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog start the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would rather like to print out this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see part of a database by showing only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the preview pane view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual it is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version which you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, specify the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should be included later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page. you can find detailed information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. as a result, you can avoid that information is displayed, which are visible to the viewer without a description. note that all images are from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so he can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all of your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check whether they really are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will run in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described settings have all three related to base-folders or URLs. in them, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time signing up the picture information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you need to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of all images in the file is that you can have all the images together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the pictures in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files are searched.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If manually copy the .kim file to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to close the .kim file, copy and photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you still want to do so, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you choose a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is called by your database. therefore, in the third dialog window you'll be asked what categories of the file to be imported and which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. you can see an example of this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you see pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will learn the different steps from (1) Placing the information about your images, (2) the search and reputation, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal security tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notices the folder in which your images are stored and automatically reuse them in future starts. if you would like to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window by which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e., for example, to set up all members of a group in a group instead of all groups of a member as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; it shares its module system with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plug-in interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that the modules are tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules over KIPI use together are very different, making it possible that some modules work with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are releasing their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & photoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, we have to deliver a photoalbum; the modules also provide a list of albums. here goes & photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people, for example, will use & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are not compatible with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists using a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family party and the same 5-10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures, you can, by way of moving the names up, find and assign the persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon on the date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add them with comments. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the thumbnail image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received several images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview. to show you that it is a hypergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and drop it down to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. note that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the branches that form the top edge of the frame. you can also create your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... that offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then fade out the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures in case you have not set filters. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview section. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the removal button or select Clear in the Edit menu. now the window will show you what you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images even without you having stored on the hard disk. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9 the preview images are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then duplicate them. so if you want to avoid irritation, how to avoid mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end of the pictures you want to make accessible to others, and click the latest view block in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may view and lock the menu item Anything out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which pictures are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item to lock images, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other you can read or delete the password as an unencrypted text. this kind of password protection only serves those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point. for this reason has & kphotoalbum; over a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the top of the image you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and drop it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with trombone and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image. you can use the mouse button to draw a rectangle with the mouse button. the Plus key zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the same key the zoom places, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomal operations that work in videos work in and zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter those names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so if you have any images that you edit, print or whatever you've selected, then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you want to view categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will be allowed & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your drawing later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; turn on On the picture from the pop-up menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovModeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation on & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will appear, so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; Reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL User Documentation to be able to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the properties pane and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera's control points. you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeling; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a present view, drag the passer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to place multiple views on top of each other, drag the passer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card leaders at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from anchoring, drag the passer to the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with window order view. it displays a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual is written, was & Povray; 3.5 actual. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering symbol Rendering the Rendering symbol in the toolbar or rename the menu item view Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you just want to render a small area of the image, select the check box sub-section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality of the combination you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections illumination. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixels with. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is repeatedly split up and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the adjacent pixel, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Abs = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually monitored and checked for further subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you switch on Jittering, changed & Povray; the Rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha channel is to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovModeler; not yet the full range of commands by & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovModeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovModeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type mark.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the objects displayed, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the detailed fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses an expanded projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the bottom, a floor below the objects is rendered rendered. the bottom is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the channel smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window Ordinance section explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: shows all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeling; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window classifications display all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with flashcards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovModeler; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeling; the default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovModeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit item Edit. therewith you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button or press the button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body quacks) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeling; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited final level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first sub-object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the preview button you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. so always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities again, but take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and sphere in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called single-color. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree each time you choose one-color and change the colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already easily perform this step as you should have understood the basic way of working & kpovModeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the button or the button Apply), so the ball will float above the bottom as you have shifted the floor to one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have selected the ball, you can assign a material to it now. as in the ground, give the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Objects and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select Regions and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the screenshots below and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already give some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovModeler offers. hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeling;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the last reverted command. you can only select this menu item if you have used editing undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting up & kpovModeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new shortcoms for & kpovModeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove toolboxes for & kpovmodeling tools using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model every bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to a pixel basis by using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuhn show; is a comfortable viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the & LMBs, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any picture should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, players, playlists, playlists, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog, so the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum' from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script. '' dialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of templates in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default script of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to show the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is alluded to. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to retrieve additional information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume displays a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to selected files of the playlist when a user-defined menu entry can be clicked. to remove an entry, use dcop Amarok script pCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the creation of amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can unload it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page by & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus. maybe you're also looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then, the playlist browser is right for you. and if the decision is still hard, choose dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. additionally, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many other useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any trouble when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kdes; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies have to be fulfilled for them to be used. see the system requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog. the Setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the playlist, the player window will turn on or off the player window. if the option is disabled, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when moving & Amarok; Enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist at the end of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece when changing the play, causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; Setting. using proprietary fonts, the otherwise gray section is activated. you can select scripts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of user-defined color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme. use the color selection activated by it for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Replay at startup causes & Amarok; after program start, playback automatically continues with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The On-Screen display subwindow allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is used, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can choose which screen of a multiple monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The flashcard audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & Amarok should search for music files. in order to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains cross-check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed as well as their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder for changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists then appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination box Driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the host where the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load .fm card card addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can send the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send unplayed pieces and update the profile: this setting allows it & Amarok; to send the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedtelescoptop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will provide for example trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library for days. you can locate the file by searching in ~ / .kde / share / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer at bug.kde.org and append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer at bug.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib, but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, turn off automatic when inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but don't label them as a Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokarapp: symbol lookup error: amarokup: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9hPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokart' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; just an empty playlist will appear. how do you get into music?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the interface, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you'll find it under Tools Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist on the playlist and select column Display comment. you can also use the new review column to determine the rating for a piece. you can also use the short instruction Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to use audio at the same time. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixers (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide another sink (e.g. ossinge).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. do not forget that media must first be decoded. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Even XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with the highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download Fmpeg, compile and install it. then, merge all the ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the add-config / GStreamer-config file folder) and execute the merge registry.</seg>

<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch to the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the scroll bar to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 default settings, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer checkbox, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section of this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also show cover images, which were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the given pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information is to be displayed in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in each section to start playing immediately. you can right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com according to the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the performer and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - album - Sorted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your tracks are displayed first by genre and among them according to the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly beneath the toolbar. it behaves in the list view and in the tree view. references to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There is a selection box under the search filter with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leaks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Add the selected pieces from the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlists. you will be asked by a name in which the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for the transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section about the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">"" "the album is no longer listed under" "" "Various Interpreters" "" "but again under the accompanying artist." ""</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">You can also create created smart playlists. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e. g. iPod). for example, to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, find the pieces sorted on your iPod to interpreter in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">There is a search area under the toolbar with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can retrieve music from a entered URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file music.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to append files by simply dropping files. in the event, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: thus dropping files are automatically added at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop them. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain whitespace, then close the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-clicking in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it includes buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left side you can add buttons that you can add to the playlist. right next to it, you can save playlists, empty lists and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you've shown in the player window through the right mouse button. you can set up & Amarok's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for toolbars, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set toolbars there.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all the pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieving is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, deselect the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. you can access the settings of & Amarok by clicking this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry hides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information to & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature, you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece in the queue, the playlist appears next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces are played: 1 is played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the play in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are predefined (the details to set up these will follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audio crobber). this mode requires that you already find some pieces in your playlist. you do not need a Last.fm profile to work with this dynamic playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the two programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line. to make use of the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b has started. then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; programs in common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface from & k3b; features features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void QValueListlt; DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void QValueListlt;) void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name) void createFolder (QString Name, QString Superior) void addUrl (KURL url, QString Superior) void QString path, QString New Name) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PRO</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it, easy to read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the cdparanoia interface (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on disk) and by many encoders that are encoding these WAV files (lossless compression) default supported (these encoder packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if it is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggable (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed which are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welter Kodierer has a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD;. this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protect the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done once (the setup dialog may be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), then the daily use to read a & CD is explained; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble on in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB requests the CD data according to the device's request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when a encoder has been configured in the Setup Settings tab - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the Setup dialog, the encoder settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure notifications (such as logs, picks) for program events (such as reading & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main direction dialog of & kaudioCreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, for setting up the encoders). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is nevertheless included with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high audio quality (for high bit rates), but compared with OGG, slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - initially in 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate app. 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autostereosystems. but not good enough for better stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or fetched automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add titles to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title must be added to & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that information can be downloaded / entered, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this is meant by the author) am not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator, set up to use freedb, the geo-geo is to be used at the nearest mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more about it, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the right distribution first if it hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) are displayed on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoder. more information on Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can receive more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). you need to replace 'lame' by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can, for example, be found using a search engine, since it is considered as not completely free software.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg, trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudioCreator; something that is likely to be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what for each reading & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them when reading a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card general settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be checked / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, please select, so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry is found immediately when you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; Rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection box and freedb is not used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if this is worth it. to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server via the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts, but this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but as many firewalls stack the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send any data to the freedb server. to disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously absent pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know it, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files are created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances you have to look right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo-stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 'tags can also be dropped if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dualcore or square or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just completed the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD is running on the disk. we will create and set MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up because we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; use which is not yet included in freedb, the screen photos look a bit different than those for a & CD; with success of freedb cut data. therefore, you will learn to input data manually, rather than picking them out of the internet. comments will point out the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is to be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then look in the section Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully collected by the freedb, all songs of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there, a window will appear, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - Enter the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; in accordance with the pattern on the next screenshot. title of the piece in the first line of the 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'News Title' input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be dividually used for the individual comments, the commentary box of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary range. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which obviously agrees with the style of the outgoing CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after selecting" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read out. make sure that all pieces are selected or press the button All items on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process has been started by clicking on the selection button, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the job tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read to the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error when trying to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format. this is done by reading and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration option to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions contain a pre-compiled package, since & kaudioCreator; part of an important & kde; package is. if you are reading this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many options. the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu has been clicked after the initial startup of the program, without any indication as it should go on from this empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; located in the drive at the time of the program starts), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; playing a piece, you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which uses a song, so you don't have to manually set the karaoke text. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries of text or text events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in sequence. in this section is how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection under the item Organize. click New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection is included in the beginning of the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the counterfeit in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. keep in mind when you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition is enabled for the collection, automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. then the pieces will continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, select the next song from the menu item or press the key arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button preceding piece, the previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map transforms general-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you just have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "The name of keymap... END Define keymap" Another keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sound to the percussions channel. take a look as an example of the provided keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio pitch-benefit events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, this is converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI Settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, Part MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to show the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use it. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore supported & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic setting of the collection to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or go (if I play a MIDI file) or start playing a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the file to the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file just quickly, without adding them to a collection, switch off automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, BA and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically Add to the collection and open Amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play Bmid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to write further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. I'm currently studying programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and proving phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really want to send me a joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get money from anybody. I would therefore like to emphasize that I only need to reprogrammer because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends significantly on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the Durable Playlist category.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you click an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current item ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. simply click on a name of a category, then select from the View menu and choose the next editing mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML contents of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 oblong option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / mp.xml and ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically stopped by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end of the animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt</seg>

<seg id="1721">"" "another tool for troubleshooting is the" "" "console" "" "button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here, the output of mplayer is visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, such as setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in set-up dialog file assignments from KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a given back end for a specific mime type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually altering the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion must be functional for the X server. therefore, for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source, introsource, pipesource, tvScanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and v3 source.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there critics like I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play off from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>

<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {order}), the command generates an empty line (for example\\ end {order}). this function can be set up in the menu box, and the LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most difficult and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, the search search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI-file [device independent file] was created], jump & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; -source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the original output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the click search, the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section is in the & latex; the default search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex has been clicked, the corresponding point in the DVI; file is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used to work with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; -source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is in this mode, and does not operate, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the first drop-down box for quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">"" "the program" "" "Schedule" "" "is for the introduction of articles such as: keywords, key notes or references. the possibilities for customization are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a defined term (choose a box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entrances is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¤e is used for determining the font size. you can specify the font sizes for the main text, the feet notes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps according to the command\\ documentnode include the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu of the menu or the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; the storage will automatically expire.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document compiles fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging. if it is used by Quick Building, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the written text is created 12 and only a couple of columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then allows the change of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are covered only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to increase the legibility and usability of the document. it can be added, for example, certain fonts, grease, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for the italics and is until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or other environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Percentage: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language has been presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. for this, a quote, a few places in fat and cursive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer). the window must be closed to an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device-independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI-file into other formats. once the DVI-file is made from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in changed other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows direct jump from editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, just set up Modern in Settings box... Tools build up.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To complete the prefix search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on thumbnail search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; viewer takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document by & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & box; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (setting up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using Quick Building der & DVI (viewers), there may be a mistake. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Logging File then displays the error source in the source code. in the editor, then the bugs triggering LaTeX errors and the latest LaTeX errors can be used for errors between errors. in order to view the flawed line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jumps to the flawed line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button in the toolbar is clicked, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten or used for the quick creation of a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must open or create a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting a file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using a new document, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings General are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used like this:\\ DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& boxes; used as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & posters; and to experience its options, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's works with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; offers a very practical & latex command reference, which can be accessed via the LaTeX reference guide. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the Ctrl key to select the & tex; that means clicking on\\ par by\\ par\\ big.it is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a twisted Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and to highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping tokens. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries Edit Drawings or the corresponding button select the jump to the next or last jump mark. this also highlights this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a drawing.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile; although & Posters; already excellent options, have been added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex. & latex; always require many environments and groups and therefore support & Kile; special commands for selecting them are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Contains a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command is also called & latex; -commands with a scroll line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and removed by clicking the Del key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit surroundings for a more easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, skip to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a number of nested ambient orders, the overview of the environment can be lost quickly. this command will close the last open environment, so that the nested environment will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups intended by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right before the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the consecusive locked bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the shielded clamp a & tex; -group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many octagonal groups braces, the overview may be lost fast. this command will close the last open group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">"" "in & latex; two simple reference marks are used in & box; the" "" "character" "" "is used for two simple quotes." ""</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g., ngerman or french), so that German or French can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When holding Shift; input key for & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete & Kile within one table environment; the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et character (amp;) among each other. if this tabulator is not the one that is associated, add & box; add some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offering a good source of source code, this was added to & Kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;) still extended. there are three different modes built-in. all these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings box... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} becomes & box; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When you click the click button, the last character of the input will be removed and may be decrypted by the full list. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing skipping brands NÃ ¤brste jumping tag, and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; all settings can be made to these lists. there can be different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wipers of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for complete environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the full-time environment will result. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for reverberating environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-time environment or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment will be automatically mapped and it will appear\\ begin {. after that, the ambient expiration can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once and Kile; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the wiper list of full-time support mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of cancellations that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile can be set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word processor mode is introduced over the editing process or the CTRL + Alt space bar, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and rearrangement of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To see the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the building tools are grouped in group mode in the creation, creation, and creation view.</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all of these tools use Kommander as interface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who has worked with the & kde documentation knows my proc and how outstanding it is. if we raise it yet another piece, we give it a graphical interface! no longer depends on a terminal; just click on the symbol for the XML processor and get ready!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application requires a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in a wary working folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already mentioned, everyone who has already worked at the & kde documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the open file index.docbook is, then simply let the current working folder be selected. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; lastly, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this allows the plug-in system to benefit instantly and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we start editing plug-in editing. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and the attitude of one's own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties Dialogue events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input notes is simple. it can either be chosen from the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta. this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags including auto-completion can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted so as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Spelling of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags the closing day is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish day automatically update: when switched on, the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatically replacing accent characters: controls automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. by using button standard, the default settings can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or in other way as a file open opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting, however, is ejected from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is eliminated by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a file carrier), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings back to default when the user interface has come across by changing MDI modi and andocking / detaching views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source pane view in the shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser node in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structure tree settings, the visibility of node in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty spaces are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifler abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plugins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "download component in" "" "Only-read" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses the load. only Lese-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; whether the information entered is correct, even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger plug-in concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available which adds support for the use of & guberbed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger appears. normally appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if required, or it shares the plugin with, listen to debug claims. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally not care must be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. close the connection to the debugger or terminate listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without informing information about the variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger runs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, but if possible in functions and include it will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the directive and proceed to the next as if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; front end and a KPart of xsldbg that they can find at http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus; to suit your needs and how you can help & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; capabilities like car completion and knotting. their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s consist of two parts, the Tag folder and the toolbar. Tag folder contain two file types, the Tag folder and the toolbar .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic-oriented buttons of image buttons (above the edit window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details of the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the & descriptionsrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute, etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that collates the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each and lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will be replaced. this will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is above in & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, only checking the TagXML files in & quantaplus is currently being checked.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file will be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for DTD processing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for editing a & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = headland 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD directive. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. clicking New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button abbreviation assigned to this action. by clicking the user's button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keine the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; self are the Schnellstart -Dialog, or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscripts / scripts / scripts / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is substituted with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is attached to the PID-number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can accept inputs from & quantaplus; input can be specified in the input field, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can be redirected accordingly. there are two types of output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages sent to the standard output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written to the standard edition by setting the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the fields you need and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them, enable dialog "edit day" when available to allow input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we'll use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel as default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is going to be included; tag; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, if any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into multiple groups. open the toolbar to set dialog via Settings tool bars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by checking all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the document HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index Top Element = your description for these files e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and, consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Whitespace does not affect anything, but pay attention & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which serves to shape the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation should be displayed directly for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of comma-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc according to $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified them in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -community.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or anywhere else. in different places there is an email with an email, like DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that the contributions are verified and only available if our team needs them as correct and beneficial for the publication. to make a positive contribution, we recommend to sign the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your personal GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the New Resource exchange, the input fields must be filled in (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD packages (DTEP), the toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts tree menu.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, inspected & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears indicating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creating can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and DTD Convert menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">A type definition string: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand and fully benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who is & quantaplus; available. from toolbars about actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special promotions designed specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoggles the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main sections: the editor window, the tree view, the flashcards with info and toolbars. please beat in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as close the current, other or all file riders, reload, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarking or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click edits in the editor area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse pointer, or opening the file, when the string under the mouse pointer denotes a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the symbol that represents the day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building mansities (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and roam. in the representation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global Templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the application system, which is aligned to the content, allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two deceivers at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in front of its bin folder.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & html-editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a nearby idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; therefore the suitable & IDE; to be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why developing what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-made actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can increase almost every task. by the program Kommander, they can expand & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code pieces and entire files as templates for later use. if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are a special character to the & html; -Description, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Scheme, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Toggles the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP script causes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and turning of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the icon column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project management. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be added by settings actions... added. toolbars are saved by toolbars toolbars or you'll be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps at the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; that has made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; the insertion by means of tool bar is denied if this day is contradicting the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an enabled plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemas depends on the grades; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line end identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; tidy with the remote application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or create unnice graphics. recommended by flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that matches the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open window. selecting a single entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the Editing Pane's behaviour. in the documentation of & posters; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled in.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without whitespace with the extension webinj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except for processing local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of serversed scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If there are files somewhere in the main folder of the project, let's get involved. if a project is started anew from scratch, don't hook into it.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can select a precise selection according to Gutenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or modified with Shift; F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards possible) that are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view of the content of the server for each profile, by showing its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, event actions can be switched on and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webplj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically stored. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are the same, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Different profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten when it comes to programs. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; you can create many high-loading profiles so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. during editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slave. at least you should choose from & FTP,, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is hidden on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; preferably stackable via the toolbar menu. use and Add differ. adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the icons can be inserted either via context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, can be executed other actions such as tool bar, rename tool bar, or set tool bars to be displayed, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and Settings dialog. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically a document skeleton, code escalopes and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a basic file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you submit to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents by means of shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. a simple framework for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template save as Local Template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template save choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and placing on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can use all file management functions for it, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files tree view can be clicked to a folder on the right and select site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can provide headlines and footers or dynamically integrate with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of container as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this option is blended as soon as elderial attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular staff in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a written text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate header lines / footers through copying of content templates into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor in a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the VPL; editor synchronous. pressing F9 this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta. if you choose from VPL; you can choose between synchronisation by one click or automatically. in principle, the time period can be adjusted automatically. basically, the recommendation is: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">It is assumed that you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the tag encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, for example, keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor can be used like in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual. the cursor functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing keys or deleted using a back button or a rangle.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way via the tool bar, as in the source code editor. it must be noted that the insertion of tags already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables wizard or the list assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists have to be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you when comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more anger if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by just writing the filename of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 kDiff3 folder 1 Folder 2 folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 3 folder 1 Folder 3 folder 2 Folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop-down list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. however, if a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also handle this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kDiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd only have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C associated. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected you see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are checked, the line is represented on a broken line.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Modify] if you have edited the result. usually it contains already text by automatic merging already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to find the remaining resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the batch by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in case you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and place somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when ignoring the numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, see how you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. by inserting button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the section together and the editable output window is explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / first difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upside / Ctrl picture wards) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the flag to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you select, automatically copied to the clipboard and manually copy it. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline sign\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line extension\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also places fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the chosen script does not support this presentation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be asterased. on these systems, the preset button automatically introduces an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard, and manually copy to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first, you will find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others only store a newline character '\'.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even minor differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complex and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is continued.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter for scanning the folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation for inventory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is appended the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file with the suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must stop & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is set global by the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is enabled, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding specifies a short notice, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress upliftment of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This option is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Assign the comparison windows to each other or overlapping each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command will only be used for line intervals. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command to convert newlines to uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another processing command for line abuses. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erft. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erft / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line abuser algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line matching preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really carrying them out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, do not merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you browse the folder, you will be informed of a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually worked together. you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even though the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is green only green, then yellow becomes red and later when it's old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge (unsure) is enabled, then research & kdiff3; the date of the files and proposes the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, merging the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after another. you status column shows Fertig when the merge operation was successful, and correspondingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is ok all over.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full analysis, KDiff3 will show further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all matching actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the three-folder merge mode C is used as a destination, in the two-folder merge, B is chosen as the destination and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all the entries: select / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to select only the current entry: select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types still exist invalid merges actions, a message appears that indicates the erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options through Execute, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kDiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select / resume directory management again or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you commit the merge (F7 key), a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you will have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, these entries (in the current session) will not be shown again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be viewed as completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kDiff3; (Set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Folder-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the main advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a previous point will mark a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether to display these files in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic linkages are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folder will be treated and recursively searched. (note that if the option is turned on, the links will result in an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (type a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it might be quicker to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the familiar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they are the same size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modified date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge command remains visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option list & text window to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You may prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder. once you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: new.</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, they are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # will have the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link appears to a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Confidentition of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select in KDiff3Part to view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist from the patch file. then & kdiff3; the patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file is created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparison of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now there are complies) exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can lead together like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by taking a look at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical. if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines are next to each other, this is the case this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor takes notice of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly flushed; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the & kdiff3 basic subfolder; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compile. if you still encounter difficulties, please report on the & kdes; -mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Removing) Copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders are not in folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after making changes to these options, you will need to re-read the folder with the update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files when merging aren't copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior is probably changed in a later program version) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C inscription below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. downtimes in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, end them or move them. this works in both a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries to set up Pager. if clicked, the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries will be minimized, maximising, working area and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager; show the numbers of the virtual desktop. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs will be shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">The window with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically let & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from Pager applications are known in some other window managers; horizontally displays all virtual work surfaces in a vertical row, which is very well suited for display on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set-up selector switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen loupe. you can use & Kmag; you can read a part of the screen as if you read a magnifier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as pictured above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the magnified area of the screen. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default scale & Kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can indicate a selected screen area in the magnifier window (drop window mode) or the area of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg. on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifier window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer holds a while in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the mouse might also cause pain. if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps when clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and results in a mouse click as soon as you break the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shift activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulated the mouse button. now move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligible shift is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & mousetool; after the mouse button is down, wait before the mouse button starts again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse-shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokel.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider Sound Buffers you can set to a lower value to shorten the response time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; this function is only available under & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde. please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window prompts to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the user's last push.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that do not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse moves, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse over mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be left by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you are using & mousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. as a result, the status of & kmousetool is reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas for toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; use it instead: execute a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. as a result, every time, when and mousetool; the mouse button is played like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the intelligent move starts. later you can use the intelligent shifting without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you need to install the XTest extension for & X-Window. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor falls short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those who use the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part the text passagedirectories are displayed as a tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part, you can edit a selected entry. if you selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the respective shortcut shortcut. if you selected a text passageway, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Adding actions such as new text passages or books or deleting selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting the menu bar, toolbar or pull-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of languages listed above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the Synthesizers to the supported languages.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech synthesizer's program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tart; to use another synthesizer, please contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the XML conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile it, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages kdelibs and development files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; from the source text archive for cunning or downloaded the tarball currently created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts; first check if speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech-dispatcher is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into single sentences. the user can return set or paragraphs, repeat, pause or break the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts; hands-over, it may request the properties of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it is used, otherwise the best suitable speaker is selected. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a speaker selects, look for.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on the Add-on tab, and in order to insert a speaker into the list, or click Edit, the box-card speaker system will be shown. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you only have to type festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices that are known, this setting is automatically made. generally, Western languages are used ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slide controls allow you to adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few controllers and display them gray, the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or forgot to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected when starting kttsmgr the program window kttsmgr will be displayed. otherwise, only the kttsmgr icon is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr doesn't work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here, all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can proceed or return on the order selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes of the settings (also on the other flashcards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the audio card audio. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Here only text orders are listed and administrated. output of screen readers, alerts and messages will not be displayed. for more information on the types of message by & ktts; find in.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, & ktts; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or & ktts; can not load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If you want to use GStreamer or aKode for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200.% about double normal speaking speed. to enable these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to adopt the new settings for the current & ktts; -System.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out which device works with you. in doubt choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card card, you can set up specific actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. once the output of the screen readers has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have just read a long text on a web page, you can with & kmouth; however, greet someone who just steps into the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To be able to read Knotfy messages, start kttsmgr and click Notifications. the card notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Mark this check box to enable the reading of & kde. if this setting is not checked, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications where a sound is played is not read by & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down box to specify what & ktts; to do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want. standard selects the speaker that appears in the list on the list of speakers as top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All Notifications for Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this you can specify the Notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for notifications in a file. use the Load button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all items except All Notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice, speaking speed, volume, voice and pitch. furthermore, SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the default voice, the festival is used for the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100g;%, SSML is usually very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN "" http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN "" http: / / www.w3.org / KDTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN "</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs can start & ktts; faster to start reading because only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the statute border detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; a set border recognition filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add further set boundaries recognition filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the choice of subscriber selection by trying out. turn off the subscriber selection and select text for reading. check on the card menu assignments, which speaker & ktts; select. turn off the speaker selection, change some features and check how the choice of the speaker is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then hold or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal statute recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set boundaries recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulators are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knot), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal sentence delineation filter by mistake, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card menu subscriber selection you can override the subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the speaker card speaker). in other words: no speaking abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise, selects & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original settings.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't play a role, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may wish to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr cuts immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashing and & ktts; was finished. probably you have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, you may install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA doesn't work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, freeze & ktts; one. on the & console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">In your system, there is the problem that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. please refer to the ALSA project (dmix) on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it at festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals, add the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card audio there is an adjustment speed. to make this work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizermods such as Festival Interactive offer an adjustment for speed on the flashcard for speaking devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speed settings are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML envelope filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. in order for the festival to produce no errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags to change SSML. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I added a custom label translation filter and now I can proceed in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the track record orders will be shown, the order will only consist of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead use a filter for punctuation recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by invoking the GStreamer in & ktts; the follow-register command. (HTTP: / / gstream.freedtelescoptop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also includes, you can't play music simultaneously and read a text. & ktts; also freeze when you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install apt-get install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you downloaded & ktts; as tarball (with tar archive), register as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least built on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the rules of the Debian distribution). the configure option column shows the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The default setting is & ktts; in / opt / KDE3 installed. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = destination. for example</seg>
<seg id="2766">On Debian systems, / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources.</seg>
<seg id="2767">CD kdebug echo kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before using & ktts; first check if your synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported. in many voices, you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you would like to let websites be read, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to set the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is normally included in the & Linux; distributions. therefore, look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA, synthesizer. then the festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete language translation system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphonic files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. festival creates this by & MBROLA; needed diphone. txt2pho can also be generated from German lyrics Diphone. more information can be found at.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure additional wrapper code will be added to the festival to use & MBROLA; -voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; -voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA, but in the file festival / lib /. instructions can be found at</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German & MBROLA; -Voices. required is either Festival Version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kecontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the Network Setting module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and the setting of network properties possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices in installing & Linux will be installed, installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the dealer selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. by marking the setting non-recurring requests, the setting can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can be viewed only, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can access the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network Interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to be edited in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are made from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further setting is required. in the drop-down list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask field, the subnet mask must be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & konsole; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. turning an off-off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution computer part of the list name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be added to the priority list by selecting an entry and descending or downgrading in the list with the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... it will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named above describes the hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add... The New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of the static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately implemented in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork.conf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other functions.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread use. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point that provides a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section are the configuration files affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is no other content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in SuSE. another stand as expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar which furthermore provided dds2tar's ability for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& Cdat; do the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & kdat; do not recognize the tape on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the prefix, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting by & kdat; it requires a tape to be formatted before using. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after finishing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files listed in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in the local file tree with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkbox has been started, the dialog box appears for review. in this dialog, you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before reproducing, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog box will appear to restore. in this dialog, you can even check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restoration settings, the dialog will restore. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should be done. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files contained in the same file system are stored in the same file system as the folder. folders residing on other filesystems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry is considered from tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command will be load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection to the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the band is ejected automatically. do not use this option for Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; the hardwary block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2936">The tape-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be directly administrated with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; ist ein & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open it. if you don't have a small message window, you will probably not have started with system administrator privileges.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or after entered strings. in the default setting, the selection box next to the Filter contains the entry All. then, a protocol line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, select the name of a process in the protocol file System Protooll, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, and show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the step error are displayed with a showy color as a protocol-line of the step indicator. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only specific processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the To New Lines option in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named as so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for checking the program start-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone could attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without re-installing and re-formatting. so you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to run when switching the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, that is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at different places and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can manually edit / etc / inittab from your hand and change the 3. if you want to run a bit, then come back to reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server -runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running levels or move the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new section. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, running level 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another runlevel, move it with clipping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the required runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine is constantly running. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just end off without a message if their configuration files are not present or set incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user groups. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have extended system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is created, on which you can make individual settings. more card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card card appears, if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one built-in filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quotas user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primarian Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group Dialogue features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. editing or Deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
