although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student , uncovered the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were keen to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method You , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of his opinion behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries were the highest number ever achieved by the nom@@ inees of the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and its voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , who takes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp doesn &apos;t agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values embodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp had gu@@ essed his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as the ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down to those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ret . Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebellion against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; p@@ un off white in allu@@ ding to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones named , has killed just that which America has so magni@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America means everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of an Ken@@ yan man whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , a huge part of the White Americas gives up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Turkey &apos;s land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) is playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it .
a music school with 100 students has become central to the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with brilliant eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn daily for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials produced at a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Chávez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate the viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ aya and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of music of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio saw something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from apost@@ asy .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release occurs under an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly anger@@ ed and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to stop one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which cris@@ sc@@ ros@@ ses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network are , in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the prime minister drove out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail rate , which circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship is dischar@@ ging its captured fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were travelling and possibly even if they have a criminal code .
on the basis of this information , countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the Prime Minister &apos;s case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is then about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishing in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
among their practices , such as sailing under false flag , fake licence papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole attempts to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a Model Programme
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project which allows a global system to allow the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously had been f@@ ished without license and barely expected consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now seen a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets , their use prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we are now copying other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they now combat illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country of Somalia got its first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the road also without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning &quot; the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( like the re @-@ or@@ ying of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also held in other parts of the country - including in the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental shift ; however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes in her latest article the context of government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated to be 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and wide @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment for many is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new alliance alliance .

the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter there are images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government , according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national guests don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the scale of repression a day :
thus dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your tur@@ mo@@ il !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , had little to do with the disa@@ strous economic crisis , and rather occupied themselves with breaking critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was first published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Córdoba city of Córdoba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now declared his father as part of the great La Per@@ la ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba .
during the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and murder@@ ers .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there , I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with an ERP .
don &apos;t forget that you don &apos;t have to kid@@ nap you one day and I have to rescue you .
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

over there the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners were tortured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a cha@@ ste where people were tortured .
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached it at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they seldom bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty angle .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing down - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the proximity of the entrance , people stood quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you come here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero sm@@ ashed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , charges the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way in which the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be transferred .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things home .
at that time at the age of age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war bri@@ des are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sig@@ nage , which one takes to an enemy that one has fought .

but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war tur@@ ner but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ es cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded fur@@ y , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I finished in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ over pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the Defence had accused me of being a co @-@ author of this crime . I replied , no problem , they could lay me on the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you will recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but what would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother who had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could have put them in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I reck@@ on it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act that can be done to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I reimbur@@ sed the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me for being pre@@ bi@@ ased . I finally ended up against my own father .
in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was placed under house arrest still at the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , torture of 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ ings .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including ex @-@ military officers , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research for that lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence have been witn@@ essing a particularly mis@@ fortune in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word was printed on a label , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who pointed out the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported how follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , gives reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the particularly un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ apt against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How accurate is the translation really not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ is@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French , not French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that can translate translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic phrases that arise through mechanical translations demonstrate that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but of large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , we can expect more thorough translation .
in the future Kyoto , Kyoto takes advantage of a more serious source of its translation .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and on television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was m@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ lock : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
deals like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ kes later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
previous research by the Institute for Presse and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
for V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman el@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a cur@@ ly report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ underlying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she once returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke proudly about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ ta one calls in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; do something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon happened , which takes place in the bor@@ rower in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ ICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozens of people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her crime .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - when it comes to Paragu@@ ay@@ an history for the first time in the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as a workforce , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master than eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition titles such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her not to give faith to the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that there would be &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak to her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , explains them .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
Hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the tra@@ iling in the ad switched off once more :
dear girl@@ friends , I found one . I &apos;ll look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the pre@@ history of Paraguay ) , during which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , who ens@@ la@@ ved the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors in Paraguay , and the native population were subjected to tribute , and the indigenous population went into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations on the use and benefit of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a position would then be set up to grant citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could have a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a cash penalty .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as an &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is run across the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video speech and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft has no indication of how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , a parliamentary committee and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in English &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices commented :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Legisl@@ ative Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose senses the control will be maxim@@ ised and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those destined to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; insti@@ g@@ ating protests . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian Leop@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ u@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are endangered by po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian Leop@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shooting of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting up protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan Region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , has been progres@@ sing to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ t@@ ess Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to flee because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from the local perspective which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .

the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitutes were completed ( for example , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by temporary shel@@ ters ( under the command of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) are still being res@@ ett@@ led into final plac@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
in 2011 , nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours resume their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , moved large areas .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far down .
the tourist elections in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coast @-@ inhabitants find it harder to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to find an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the displaced people . it asked them about the status of re@@ building and how their feeling has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the indigenous population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its release on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated city of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent re@@ plac@@ ements .
after the state of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas most of the displaced people still live in shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are known to reti@@ re due to efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the similarities .
after a while , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care station : last Friday a police officer had taken him to the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . across the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás conf@@ essed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the completion of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he beats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer smu@@ g@@ gled on a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be watching television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video filmed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which it is seen how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and receives several plum@@ bing briefly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in a different state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva who is on the intensive care station after he has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a stick in his face .
police Contro@@ ls
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police missions on demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to for@@ ego violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de São Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , Brazilian media have covered road protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protag@@ onist - a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were reported in a targeted manner using a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
devast@@ ation of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in all of Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site .
it has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry stagn@@ ated in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane manufacturers in the east of the region , which are in use after a long period of time because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry was already resist@@ ing the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the community saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane manufacturers were technically obsol@@ ete , and barely competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , sugar prices rose again a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published according to the report &quot; Agriculture perspectives &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the export of raw sugar would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander during his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane manufacturers , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he says most frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those surve@@ yed said that not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers who were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work sheet producers was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the people who were present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .

after two years , the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to stamp it , they also ceased to asp@@ ire the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they were used to spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the congregation .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ four harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement with 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;

as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups the song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop will thus increase that the young participants will discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protag@@ onists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also collabor@@ ated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sw@@ Cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia explains , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a stretch of road in West Can@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
for the most part , the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a lot in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available as a tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you become our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and continue our youth as well
how can they do what they destined for the Creator ?
in the comment section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) out of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are exhibited near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry which is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
there are a large number of these small companies in the to@@ ki@@ otic district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic j@@ ars decorated cell phone tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few pictures of fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an orph@@ an @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition at the railway station in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dies ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # to be up @-@ to @-@ date .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug trafficking &quot; ) that should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and therefore entire communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ gen@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fe@@ ar Life Chang@@ ed Life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend secret tom@@ bs .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and to seek graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he was supposed to be back , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they are ridi@@ cul@@ ing those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hom@@ el@@ essness of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the city district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals resi@@ ded money from their business month for month , until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never fails , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also have changed .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself if wines were going to dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ent Generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had passed two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen &apos;s council for public security and the government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising rum@@ ors or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fications .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pass on .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to manipul@@ ate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the eastern part of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded , and 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
representative representatives described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie in the vicinity that was full of people who watched the soccer world championship .
houses per@@ ished and lam@@ inated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for recognition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been taken several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dr@@ astically reported atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from DR Congo , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely acc@@ use the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning strike , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee struck be@@ atings , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , following these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein being said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image of the DR Congo to see this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false statements
traces of these false combinations date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwarded incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have introduced examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what they have been published on which page they have been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also linked ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of incorrect connections of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers where the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or false reports are still available .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the ho@@ ax message , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used to deli@@ mit , since the photos have been used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately ingenious news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this exercise , which has appeared exclusively in English , includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding molecules that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , real@@ ises that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ an being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , published now , has expressly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was circul@@ ated later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dunk@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo showed up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message which was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to be false .
from the message in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in gray ) , Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / dat@@ est@@ amp exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and spor@@ adi@@ cally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which have only been released after the original return of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that pull these posts through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second frame uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of thousands who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rower the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
an argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ fy readers and audience and to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo@@ by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. unmistak@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ br@@ ush@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not sufficient , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ sla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , like :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pain@@ t around your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite songs here .

how Sri Lanka revol@@ ves around the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently faced with the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon that normally takes place at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
126 people were killed after a comment from the Sri Lanka disaster center from May 28 , 2017 and just under hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud winds .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe places to stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ ets provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods deterior@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already underway .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ma@@ go@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents locked in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been able to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ut@@ ana .
please call 04@@ 77 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which enabled users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need in security and provide help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Muslims you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
when I was in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next wave , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman wearing head@@ scar@@ f , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ atter slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ used me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit in , become Muslim .
to be ab@@ domin@@ als
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you have in mind when you think of him ?
where do you go ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist , Edward S@@ aid , disman@@ tled the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ less narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that during the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even vote for their first female candidate nomin@@ ee .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ens Muslim women who insti@@ gate movements for change .
it can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination into such a deep and fla@@ wed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people
in the news industry we are more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed mis@@ er@@ ably to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of all Muslim populations are African @-@ stem@@ med Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
are approved for use .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also not be a theological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have been manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head scar@@ f .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques around the US , see below .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , if I held her in my arms and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verses for the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim part is always part of my shadow .

are approved for use .
affili@@ ation is my grandmother &apos;s painting with her sisters ; as it was decades ago a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I will see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted by Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she told me if I had a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation which - through centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; which was founded by a company named Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dine @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God the only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
are approved for use .
belonging means growing up and listening that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be a Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have colon@@ ized all of them to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped over a Muslim country in a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ a sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,7 billion one goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy comes home to the United States and the suspect has a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means to know that , two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ came the airports in order to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion ent@@ ails more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well aware that powerful and privileged people are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration li@@ aison officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from just the countries that are bombing them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decades have come back to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous expressions we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news agencies .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry which tries to capture our often @-@ marked identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate huge areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread crust track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic hos@@ tility .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being fought , and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , was self @-@ employed by Stan@@ ford , four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I have in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and un@@ seen 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling aims to preserve urban language diversity
story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not based on the written text but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already hosted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project apply :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is related to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to connect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ telling tells their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation leads to the fact that the audience joins them .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the story of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ o in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for rein@@ statement of sovereign debt by the USA
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico claimed that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities who are responsible for the debt must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debts , with a fixed working conditions corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed from outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the Paris resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ research ) .
the book , published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on its current state or place of residence .
the introductory part of his book , titled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what do we have chosen for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in charge of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; bass@@ el was based on a command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra , on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross between numerous civi@@ lizations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
lo@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life trying to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in custody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting , a sab@@ bath that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses at the moment we embrace us ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the jam of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International since 2011 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director of prison release again on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment on which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants because of an em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million me@@ tics ( some 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , which was vice @-@ president of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many residents do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to set up the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company remained silent , however , and did not indu@@ ce reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Mozambique social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
rep@@ ul@@ sive !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ als :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that he has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serving the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served himself by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora mach@@ el prison , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ators .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ah also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he rep@@ lies mon@@ ies , res@@ ides under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ж x@@ xe ( @ az@@ zy _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime in Mozambique is paying off :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ ders .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took up their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or in general use as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be linked to racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ oot A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words that are nearby .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spi@@ ders ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems like they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , that would be great .
the automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t include hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook removes the post that contains the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have increased social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Burma sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code @-@ based initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the Kindergarten
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now at 18 .
before this change of the married couple some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws for child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dar@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided tension in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubt arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but early in 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and proclaim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and no one voted against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for child@@ care were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel was the opinion that it took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ a @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ka Mut@@ a , who was a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ bearing age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the married couple was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all the dep@@ uties , who were contrary , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s toe is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ care portra@@ yal .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat @-@ Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to have his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Corn@@ ish suggested :
dear sat , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and anger , instead of talking about the problem that the state that protects our daughters from being mis@@ used may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step . however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle of Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using re@@ to@@ oling for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ preval@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article of Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) have now appeared .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is call@@ able .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( via the block of Wikipedia ) , we set out to put sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shot and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ ak &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server keeps the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was just at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a Leop@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the dam is just a few minutes away from Sau@@ ra@@ ha tourist resort .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leop@@ ard found herself and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood facing Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger is not bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bus appeared . he sits down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent to make photos of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ rat@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid taking care of the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseudo @-@ court and expelled from her family and village community after having appe@@ aled to a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far less chance to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers as well as house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ i@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates the patri@@ archy &apos;s disman@@ tling .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked with her video camera to expose practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they owe all liability and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this will be considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everybody , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ wel of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she would only lie ahead of herself during the whole exercise ; another decision was to allow all the dist@@ ressed fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ alin on having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation sounded in violence .
Roh@@ ini relates how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the jaw@@ bone @-@ red dot on the forehead that indicates sp@@ ouses :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the petrol red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed and I ceased to bear him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and aims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at every discussion club we make a trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have only carried Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they did not dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
on the question whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only done small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some people , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged mem@@ o@@ irs and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is considered to be a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , commented on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here are quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Day commemor@@ ative day in Japan .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese mid@@ schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning along .
today is Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration .
right today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration .
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is running today .
so , we hope you are here !

tall @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of tall people for the organ@@ ist , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can bring gold away or wealth , declared the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are aiming ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ anian police for the newest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ band Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of tall @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has ordered cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating wealth .
in recent days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ve on Facebook that indicated that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ UST be ashamed A country where people would have shame to walk on the street as they came from the shots of a por@@ no@@ film in which the teachers would be ashamed to take sex against good marks , a country where people would not hurt honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald men are hun@@ ted for fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and also the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald men :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an authorities are very concerned about the massac@@ res of gl@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in extending public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meeting of the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but not given any further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 1 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have campaig@@ ned for his release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans came to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New feedback from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital due to liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has called Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; internal affair , &quot; telling a speaker that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to uph@@ old views from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to treat abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
united nations
at the end of June , Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to give Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to revi@@ ve the Sal@@ mon crew in China since the exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to collect his prize in Oslo .
as a result of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top @-@ class diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they want and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ ch shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can assist him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the embassy was asking the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. embassy &apos;s request attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley indicated that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators , Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can enter a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States Minor Out@@ lying Islands
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was appearing on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to Reuters news agency that China had concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the United States
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to protect its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and to release citizens &apos; rights to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France around the world
in a statement on 29 June , China , the Foreign Ministry of France called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it .
Tai@@ pei , Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore was to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ sting logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifices , to create this valuable land , we hear that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of it , he inv@@ ari@@ ably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again by the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leave the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ciary , our political system really non @-@ responses .
he disgu@@ ised such questions with non @-@ answers in a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng asked Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to enligh@@ ten this point , provided that it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the mem@@ o@@ irs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ easy , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of an approaching generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Ministry of Justice has said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden , a member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes this , well @-@ associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokesman ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister pay bills back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for affir@@ mation , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadi@@ ans &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently their editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series where rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication , most of the time follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans might cook in@@ war@@ dly rage if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons here !
gender marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be di@@ lig@@ ently - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major achievement of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ ades Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ ades the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 , and despite their promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , giving absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change Your Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that over@@ saw online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict defence against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the Co@@ al basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ es live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , but today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &quot; s called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were congreg@@ ational centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that were all minist@@ ering to the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded orn@@ ate buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
approximately fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ov@@ kas , one or two families , one can recognize at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insist she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .

when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , Chi@@ ap@@ as State , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is here with friendly permission .
on the way of the migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people are coming in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , buying them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived shortly .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on floors on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula arrives from Central America , and other residents also open their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail his money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the gears , the travellers can quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she brow@@ s in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots , who made her an artificial female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she asks her for a short while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya &apos;s fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , with the following characteristics :
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone notification to instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean@@ ers &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded , ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Twitter published photos from a check@@ point where police insp@@ ected the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with one device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices that were meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( in @-@ house ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the directives of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all branches of government , public authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; by local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all the important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually broken up and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who ren@@ ders all honor to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn apart from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of night with &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the neighbor@@ hoods sought only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my home roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted in silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment , you become aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we &apos;re not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sorry to see me in your eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was suspended for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend all the details exactly before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they have all@@ otted to me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoner and I can immediately set myself apart , without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old established communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ resp@@ onder@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen in me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers reject his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to remove all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ori@@ ze on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries res@@ ound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror of person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian express card and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view .
this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal into a hero .
I looked into the audi@@ torium and met Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to extract as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate confession .
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cries .
give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cries .
my cries were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their perspective .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice too , which is why I listened to scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling down and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , which is why he picked up next to an electri@@ cally charged staff .
electricity f@@ lowed whole body , enough to supply all my neighbor@@ hoods .
my half @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect power conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went away , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be la@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he sl@@ ur@@ ries to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spotted lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ha@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist , confron@@ ting the conservative majority and questioned their proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking , and can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones can do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian f@@ owl of the second generation . &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he poured water @-@ café into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , having a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the s@@ war@@ ms speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry has already cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sen@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la valued the Jord@@ anian people as the &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects an ever @-@ clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to the body of traditional sex men by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex marriage .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ehren@@ mor@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a 1954 Treaty of Crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be held in prison &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and guarantee on the part of the family are required that the woman will not do anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not to shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music from politics that is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was in@@ timi@@ dated by politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically politically can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a sort of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ genei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to later note that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not consistent with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ i , a poet of the eighth century , which still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was supposed to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former govern@@ ors and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had expressed themselves critically on the problems related to the corruption of the country deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be closer to real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial kind of about @-@ made demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until it is time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will carry on further and also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing were handed over more than one thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could snap some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ j@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter high carriage was incredible .

young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and razor cut@@ ters

outside appearance and personal care seldom were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession such as the bar@@ ber &apos;s bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trade are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences growing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the out@@ lan@@ dish hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unparalleled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centri@@ city looks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair sty@@ ling tools and to get an education in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year that began in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .

the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is exactly what the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation did not go out of his head and inspired her to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la form@@ li@@ ación &apos;s campaign to write letters to young people .
only recently was their country the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried out their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
in turn , the Colom@@ bian society , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - who should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in February 2017 in Bo@@ got@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people whom we love , but forget those who need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent appeal .
the letter will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she said .
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set up as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters reside ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go into , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran to me over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also sorry for the war , was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help to make society more righteous in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no voting rights , and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those who have been turned up@@ side by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , famine and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now relying on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat , which hangs like a women &apos;s compla@@ ining about the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans @-@ sexual woman from Grand@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that discussed the ab@@ duction , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , who threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspici@@ ously qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the ch@@ ase was opened to Sab@@ rina .
in the end , they came to the United States for fear of their lives .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me .
after that , the photos of my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the rounds .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ or the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last night .
apparently some women had taken everything along and began shou@@ ting .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two bit@@ es in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which cases have you been placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having respect with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother made it too much and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to invo@@ ke my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about you , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , it is a t@@ abo@@ o subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I actually try to figure out how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in a gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
this is what I mean , they probably charge relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has gained satisfaction with blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me that there were not many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves at Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted us to approach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never just cur@@ bed a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how the people began to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worsen@@ ing .
OC Media : what is your job now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month aren &apos;t much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to buy food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded shel@@ ters .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ away ?
Sab@@ rina : this is cal@@ mer .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion at all .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you know with foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the ro@@ dents have which , the Cab@@ ar@@ in@@ ers have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet there is them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think in terms of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian tribal region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate among the indigenous Arab population .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , to the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab ancest@@ or minority , and activists in front of the place warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , they felt hel@@ pless and unable to follow a safe work .
Arab ancest@@ or suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only managed to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dro@@ ught , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ za young people has now risen to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director general for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian family human rights activist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of indigenous ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions prefer not to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab ancest@@ or will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab ancest@@ or has to endure , human rights activist aler@@ ts alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter @-@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , today , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is known to me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , black women , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention what kind of we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a two@@ fold way .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and home countries earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school are referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men . on the other hand , as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural sei@@ zur@@ es to advance their sel@@ fish program .
I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than adopting me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ ark@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming Deutsch : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradigm .
because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman , I am recognized as a part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Re@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are concerned that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Water@@ world Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ Wars Alliance - which uses and works to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly attended sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ r@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex partner who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez didn &apos;t find anything useful .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women at all reimbur@@ se , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Be@@ atings and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not prohi@@ bit Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports , but they do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available figures are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office issued a total of 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements reported by the police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads also came here .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , on every woman reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , there are two women who do not do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ense , the investig@@ ative authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to men &apos;s violence .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing &quot; &quot; &quot;
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer accompanied by Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most seriously recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take seriously the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Guill@@ aume ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ compliance ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ici@@ dal should be declared an independent crime and to punish tough@@ er as it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just pay attention and want a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence is not seen as normal .
those who keep silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must allow such a long ad until mal@@ treatment is no more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to face attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the Independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the Sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in jail where he serves a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Da@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos; rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially domestic intelligence , public freedoms , including freedom of the press , and to torture and in@@ timi@@ date independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict the peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS picked up the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the information minister had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any means , including online , is prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in front of the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both found guilty of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was charged with a security deposit of $ 5,000 ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he serves his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government of the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the ceas@@ ef@@ ire of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated freedom of the press .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Alban@@ ian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Alban@@ ian authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial kill@@ ings .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and association and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : firstly , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the supply of global health care , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more grave consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
Dr. War@@ rier spoke with Global Vo@@ ices about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that must change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker myself .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the legi@@ ble access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system means that magazines are only available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , but also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions to environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the US since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding salad , but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to mate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far in salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features have already been patented . &quot; he continues to make as good as possible and tries to extract those characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the United States and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the sort out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to buy their seeds , to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
som@@ bre prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to them , seeds play a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement does not address genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , taking on the increasingly common fu@@ sions in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always more restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted desired traits - from those that improve their taste or colour , to those that thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse than ever .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property in@@ ordin@@ ates other breeders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ als promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their job easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible unless we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US State of Oregon and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation are required mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .

in addition , Mor@@ ton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding vegetable pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , with which I think it makes it quite simple . &quot; worldwide response
although the USA seem to be leading in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is rapidly spreading across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also helps them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agreement co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si &apos;s commitment cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , so it is contrary to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source seed seed systems , &quot; that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source seed seed systems , &quot; for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context from which Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above them .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook which strongly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true to its objective to defend freedom of speech and human rights in the Arab world , despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims , it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : first human rights organisation of the wave of web page barriers to the victim fell . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer able to access Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he directed was to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of the Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself about the blocking of the government and reflected what this means to him :
blocking the blogs is very old but has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege mentality ; an arrest , a sought @-@ after murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web site I was working for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous walk the way to the end .
according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities , Egyptian authorities blocked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , enabling internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called virtual private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering information that Egyptian users could have access to .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ olds go to school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; The@@ be rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , marine and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed reporting on Viol@@ ence in Rio published on August 16 , the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new heading called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that differs from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so as not to close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty as a journalist .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ ruption , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities by the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that the violence as a &quot; war &quot; argues . this is in its opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro , considered to be the &quot; most violent place in Brazil , &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per federal state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police patch and to permanently fix a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the Rio Viol@@ ence does not meet the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police force the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

in order to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , princip@@ ally by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Syria Institute research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib are currently living around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians to live .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel areas have been under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led to the need for local inhabitants to be smu@@ g@@ gled or smu@@ g@@ gled through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a food @-@ saving food source .
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food used in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Di@@ re@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 euros , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee @-@ set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire explo@@ sions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the web and show pictures which allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the League of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law which allowed construction activity from case to case when the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val further asser@@ ts in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , always spread on fires of this species .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens searched or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so critical in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were unable to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires .

two years before , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups had broken out , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning grey the boy was supposed to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ habi party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many haz@@ ara felt un@@ fail@@ ingly .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af reg@@ ained in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to an entrance centre if they officially have an application for asylum - which can take months after the registration of asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his stub@@ born li@@ festyles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af incorporated his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the Venice City Award was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s objectives are far beyond the Italian catering trade and retail trade , aiming to return to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
citizen report : dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ar Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to use social networks , to register within six months of the law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name as well as their ID number .
anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of the Parliament filed a bill that would be introduced in the har@@ sh@@ est pun@@ ishments for the presidential or senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , it may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he showed violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a date of trial .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the def@@ endant from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are unanim@@ ous in common sense , including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ justified funds .
the document published on 21 April at the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis district court on 9 May .
does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments to be achieved within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian Government has a list of online services that organize the &quot; disclosure of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ wie@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave an end to the site because they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to support a political campaign campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
after this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
in spite of all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
