<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were keen to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method You," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of his opinion behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries were the highest number ever achieved by the nominees of the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and its voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, who takes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Trump doesn't agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "in the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump had guessed his way to the nominee Republican candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as the racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down to those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(ret. Ü): as much as" "" "rebellion against all other ethnicities" "" "; pun off white in alluding to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones named, has killed just that which America has so magnified." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America means everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of an Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trump, a huge part of the White Americas gives up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd shouted." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocal "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Turkey's land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) is playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central to the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with brilliant eyes and play in the hustle you learn daily for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials produced at a workshop for musical instruments in Cateuru, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate the violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguaya and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of music of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio saw something that he had never seen before: a violin produced from apostasy.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic Mülldeponie) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music all around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs under an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly angered and less inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to stop one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crisscrosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are, in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the prime minister drove out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail rate, which circulated between individual countries, the actions now happen in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship is discharging its captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were travelling and possibly even if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the Prime Minister's case.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "this is then about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of illegal fishing in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices, such as sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You must not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole attempts to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A Model Programme</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project which allows a global system to allow the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had been fished without license and barely expected consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now seen a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped detecting Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets, their use prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we are now copying other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they now combat illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country of Somalia got its first big triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the road also without a license and were used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's impeachment.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (like the re-orying of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also held in other parts of the country - including in the Barinas lowland area, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the impeachment of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental shift; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes in her latest article the context of government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated to be 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and wide-reaching shortage of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment for many is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new alliance alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (e.g. round table of Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="177">Especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government, according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andes State Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was first published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to join the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Córdoba city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano has now declared his father as part of the great La Perla ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">During the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realise that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there, I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">"" "everyone named him" "" "Kent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend on it.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos. he was also who pointed out the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which appeared in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The wrong English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported how follows the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, who are involved in accidents across the country, gives reason to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, equivalent to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French, not French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that can translate translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases that arise through mechanical translations demonstrate that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but of large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, we can expect more thorough translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future Kyoto, Kyoto takes advantage of a more serious source of its translation.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionists who oppose Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was mapped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Clock: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that web pages of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Deals like Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilkes later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Presse and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds erroneous or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">For VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transfer was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university, she once returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke proudly about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a criadita for the family. as criadita one calls in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the criadita guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and "do something out of themselves," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with him and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon happened, which takes place in the borrower in Paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of heavy blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military unit Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small place with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira hit Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozens of people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be" "" "no more Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to offend the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her crime.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - when it comes to Paraguayan history for the first time in the case of Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as a workforce, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as an "jedwede application, which is run across the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video speech and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft has no indication of how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the Tierschuerin Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards roams through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). they are endangered by poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "how Raza shows in the video," "" "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard in the wild is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shooting of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, has been progressing to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a great prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countess Fukushima and Iwate were forced to flee because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from the local perspective which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutes were completed (for example, saigai kouei juutaku) in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by temporary shelters (under the command of the "" "" kasetsu juutaku "" "") are still being resettled into final placements. "" "</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, nearly 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours resume their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, moved large areas.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here again Fukushima remains far down.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist elections in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coast-inhabitants find it harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to find an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the displaced people. it asked them about the status of rebuilding and how their feeling has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its release on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated city of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacements.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the displaced people still live in shelters are older than 50 years old. they are known to retire due to efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva who is on the intensive care station after he has been attacked by a policeman who has struck him with a stick in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Controls</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, in which it came to brutal police missions on demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to forego violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de São Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, Brazilian media have covered road protests by directing the focus on another, unexpected protagonist - a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were reported in a targeted manner using a broken glass window to illustratively shape their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a specific cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Devastation of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in all of Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite that there is no noteworthy sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earthquake, the sugar cane industry stagnated in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane manufacturers in the east of the region, which are in use after a long period of time because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry was already resisting the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for alarm for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane manufacturers were technically obsolete, and barely competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, sugar prices rose again a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, published according to the report "Agriculture perspectives" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the export of raw sugar would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro at the sugar factory in Lavander during his speech on 21 October 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane manufacturers, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he says most frequently," "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed said that not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers who were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work sheet producers was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut's speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the people who were present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to stamp it, they also ceased to aspire the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups the songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will thus increase that the young participants will discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also collaborated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of KitswCalum First Nation in British Columbia explains, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a stretch of road in West Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">For the most part, the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a lot in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available as a transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you become our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way they can grow and continue our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">How can they do what they destined for the Creator?</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are exhibited near the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru ("plastic models of dishes") of each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry which is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a large number of these small companies in the tokiotic district of Kappabashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning it into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic jars decorated cell phone tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few pictures of fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an orphan-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the exhibition at the railway station in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddies (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further quirky plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # to be up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking") that should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and therefore entire communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vigenque Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Life Changed Life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for his son every weekend secret tombs.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and to seek graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they are ridiculing those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the homelessness of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "sojourn" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months extortion in the city district: how a family was pillaged with threats." it describes how armed criminals resided money from their business month for month, until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also have changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as you do not know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if wines were going to dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violent Generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had passed two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizen's council for public security and the government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the eastern part of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded, and 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>

<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been taken several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count bodies," "" "said a man to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unresolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from DR Congo, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments like this example falsely accuse the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning strike, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee struck beatings, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, following these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Than being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo showed up with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events, which took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved). but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that pull these posts through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame uses the image to discuss how African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of thousands who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrower the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images desensify readers and audience and to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photoby Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unmistakeable) strives to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these placeable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sobrusha).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not sufficient, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist from "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwotslap language of Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Paint around your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik Language, spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favourite songs here.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - of the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They abused me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like me, do not fit in, become Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be abdominals</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Where do you go?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western conception, the religion of Rumi was deleted, just as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another exists in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian scientist, Edward Said, dismantled the history behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures still stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpetuate them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, flawless narratives dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that during the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US could not even vote for their first female candidate nominee.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong folly weakens Muslim women who instigate movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has cast our collective imagination into such a deep and flawed that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion people</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we are more than just telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives that help us to understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the placeable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not based on the written text but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already hosted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is related to understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel, to connect." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytelling tells their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and representation leads to the fact that the audience joins them.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamus tells the story of the hare and the baboo in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamus is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017. the march started at the Puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Rico claimed that politicians, bankers and government authorities who are responsible for the debt must be held accountable for their corruption." ""</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the Paris resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Afterresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book, titled Collective Remembrance, gives his friends and family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What do we have chosen for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in charge of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police" bassel was based on a command of the military court from his cell in Adra, on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross between numerous civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything in it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Logically, Bassel could not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life trying to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting, a sabbath that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants because of an embezzlement of 54 million metics (some 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, which was vice-president of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post, since the company did not execute any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to set up the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "says CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company remained silent, however, and did not induce reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Repulsive!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that he has so massively insulted the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "Cambaza lacks morality and serving the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only served himself by the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora machel prison, not only to be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic orators.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samah also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not like that. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took up their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still debated, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or in general use as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burma" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be linked to racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair in Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider blower), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboooot Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like this:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words that are nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spiders).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he wanted to share his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work." ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems like they have begun this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not attempt to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">The automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't include hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads:" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post states," "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have increased social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Burma sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code-based initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle of Wikipedia, based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using retooling for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN-prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article of Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) have now appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer network (i.e. machine calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is callable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via the block of Wikipedia), we set out to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshot and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speak "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server keeps the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a Leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is just a few minutes away from Sauraha tourist resort.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard found herself and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood facing Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bus appeared. he sits down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and mostly lived in a tent to make photos of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and expelled from her family and village community after having appealed to a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far less chance to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers as well as housewives, performed a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KheliBadal campaign run by the Video Volunteers community and advocates the patriarchy's dismantling.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pawas worked with her video camera to expose practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands, is a custom that they owe all liability and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this will be considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call him by his name from now on." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everybody, "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawel of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she would only lie ahead of herself during the whole exercise; another decision was to allow all the distressed frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenalin on having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation sounded in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini relates how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the jawbone-red dot on the forehead that indicates spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the petrol red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I ceased to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and aims.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "at every discussion club we make a trip." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what they hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cake for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own choice of clothes, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a panel discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lub, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have only done small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some people, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and some of the organs were taken from.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can bring gold away or wealth, declared the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of tall-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has ordered cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been admitted to hospital due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China has called Liu's case as an "internal affair," telling a speaker that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to uphold views from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">At the end of June, Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to give Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to revive the Salmon crew in China since the exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to collect his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">As a result of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top-class diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they want and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the news agency AFP announced on 27 June that the embassy was asking the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the U.S. embassy's request attracted a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley indicated that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators, Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was appearing on the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to Reuters news agency that China had concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the United States</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China urged China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum talks about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to protect its international human rights commitments, including freedom of expression, and to release citizens' rights to exercise these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France around the world</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, China, the Foreign Ministry of France called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>

<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and affluent China, which would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to K. Shanmugam, Singapore, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice that" "" "twisting logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this valuable land, we hear that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of it, he invariably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre appears again by the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised such questions with non-answers in a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asked Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to enlighten this point, provided that it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the memoirs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneasy, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that" "" "no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment on Shanmugam, who as leader of an approaching generation makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Ministry of Justice has said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmuiden, a member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes this, well-associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "faithfully commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister pay bills back?</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification, most of the time follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians might cook inwardly rage if they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major achievement of Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band famous in Thailand has released a music video that parades the Junta, who took power in 2014, and despite their promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to reign.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"" "last month even the Charlie Chaplin video" "" "The dictator" "" "was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists called the public to watch this video." ""</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may relate to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, giving absolute decision-making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army that oversaw online content and accused persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict defence against "Lese Majeste" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup d'etat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should insult the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of the migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-colored earrings in a teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, the people are coming in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call" "" "Mama Africa!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, buying them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel the route together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he said, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on floors on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>

<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula arrives from Central America, and other residents also open their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail his money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, the travellers can quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she brows in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-spots, who made her an artificial female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, with the following characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification to instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaners").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking of pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded, ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media outlet" "" "Images from mainland China" "" "based on Twitter published photos from a checkpoint where police inspected the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with one device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices that were meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (in-house) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the directives of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, public authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" by local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates Urumqui's personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slurries to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felhayeen (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, confronting the conservative majority and questioned their proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking, and can sympathize with people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones can do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian fowl of the second generation." he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own life circumstances," "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "as he poured water-café into two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, having a cup of coffee at a scorching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the swarms speak lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry has already cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Seno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila valued the Jordanian people as the "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to choose "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflects an ever-clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan that appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved to the body of traditional sex men by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years the number of" "" "Ehrenmores" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outwardly left." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a 1954 Treaty of Crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "" "be held in prison" "", "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and guarantee on the part of the family are required that the woman will not do anything." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music from politics that is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was intimidated by politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeatedly repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to later note that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not consistent with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nui, a poet of the eighth century, which still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was supposed to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite realm, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former governors and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had expressed themselves critically on the problems related to the corruption of the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be closer to real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind of about-made democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is time, Hdaib will carry on further and also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting, where Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing were handed over more than one thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could snap some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and personal care seldom were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession such as the barber's barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trade are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences growing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the outlandish hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentricity looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair styling tools and to get an education in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year that began in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation did not go out of his head and inspired her to the Cartas por la formliación's campaign to write letters to young people.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their country the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, the Colombian society, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people whom we love, but forget those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The letter will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive any orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters reside) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran to me over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also sorry for the war, was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help to make society more righteous in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard heard and had no voting rights, and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those who have been turned upside by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commandant in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, famine and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now relying on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital last night.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything along and began shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two bites in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases have you been placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having respect with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother made it too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to invoke my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think about you, just because you have left the country?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, it is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually try to figure out how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in a gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This is what I mean, they probably charge relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honour" has gained satisfaction with blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me that there were not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves at Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>

<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it is now.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never just curbed a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how the people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed at once looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what is your job now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month aren't much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to buy food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded shelters.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeaway?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is calmer.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you know with foam before the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The rodents have which, the Cabariners have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet there is them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in terms of transience to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensations to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>

<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahrazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter-sectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, today, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known to me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, black women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention what kind of we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and "Kumbaya, my Lord," to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and home countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migration background often referred to school are referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men. on the other hand, as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refers both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural seizures to advance their selfish program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than adopting me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clarka Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming Deutsch: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman, I am recognized as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex partner who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, Ada Báez didn't find anything useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women at all reimburse, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Beatings and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not prohibit Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports, but they do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General's Office issued a total of 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements reported by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of women's ads also came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer accompanied by Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most seriously recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long ago by Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Guillaume).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# noncompliance) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that femicidal should be declared an independent crime and to punish tougher as it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they just pay attention and want a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence is not seen as normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted at the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been altered, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: firstly, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the supply of global health care, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grave consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Dr. Warrier spoke with Global Voices about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">What do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">How is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">How is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the legible access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines are only available against payment (the so-called "paywall"), but also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions to environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the US since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding salad, but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to mate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far in salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features have already been patented. "he continues to make as good as possible and tries to extract those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the United States and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the sort outredgeous in the "glasshouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to buy their seeds, to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Sombre prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi, Jack Kloppenburg control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to them, seeds play a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the open-source movement does not address genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, taking on the increasingly common fusions in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always more restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-grown crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted desired traits - from those that improve their taste or colour, to those that thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the view that intellectual property inordinates other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varietals promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "so such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their job easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible unless we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation are required mass-wise herbicides, are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly the opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, most of the smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding vegetable patrons: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, with which I think it makes it quite simple. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be leading in "open source" breeding, the concept is rapidly spreading across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, a "open source" seed programme. to maintain the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also helps them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agreement col is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi's commitment cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, stated that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, so it is contrary to the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook which strongly criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts on human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true to its objective to defend freedom of speech and human rights in the Arab world, despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these aims, it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: first human rights organisation of the wave of web page barriers to the victim fell. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no longer able to access Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he directed was to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of the Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself about the blocking of the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking the blogs is very old but has in the era of Abdelfatth al-Sisi's priority; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in giving me the feeling of a siege mentality; an arrest, a sought-after murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities, Egyptian authorities blocked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, enabling internet censorship and private surfing, so-called virtual private networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering information that Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censor and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-olds go to school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thebe robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed reporting on Violence in Rio published on August 16, the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new heading called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that differs from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so as not to close our eyes to cruelty as a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war disruption, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities by the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira is arguing that the violence as a "war" argues. this is in its opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro, considered to be the "most violent place in Brazil," is wrong according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per federal state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police patch and to permanently fix a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the Rio Violence does not meet the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police force the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, principally by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Syria Institute research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently living around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly severely affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians to live.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas have been under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus, which led to the need for local inhabitants to be smuggled or smuggled through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a food-saving food source.</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food used in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direkt of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more" "" "gaining popularity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families knowledge of the plantation of mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 euros, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "production from the regions originating from the regions" "", "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire explosions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, always spread on fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when citizens searched or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used fogos.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so critical in this fateful weekend in October that the servers were unable to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf regained in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">"" "" "" "according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an entrance centre if they officially have an application for asylum - which can take months after the registration of asylum application." ""</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his stubborn lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf incorporated his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The Venice City Award was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's objectives are far beyond the Italian catering trade and retail trade, aiming to return to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as all others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also plans plans for the opening of a Kabul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end stand stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Near Report is an international snapshot, which shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to use social networks, to register within six months of the law decision on the authority's website, stating their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another member of the Parliament filed a bill that would be introduced in the harshest punishments for the presidential or senior officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law, however, such action would be punished with prison and fines, according to legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, it may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he showed violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in prison for a date of trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatened with death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups are unanimous in common sense, including weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was acquitted of two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adaviya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unjustified funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April at the Nawaat website sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis district court on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments to be achieved within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organiser of information distribution" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian Government has a list of online services that organize the "disclosure of information." the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnowieniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has lock Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, maritime affairs and communication gave an end to the site because they were" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to support a political campaign campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian population outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In spite of all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
