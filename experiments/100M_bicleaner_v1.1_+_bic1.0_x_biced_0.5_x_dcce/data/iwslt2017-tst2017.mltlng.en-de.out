this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the NSA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally translated dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb to Iran .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government had as@@ cer@@ tained Ris@@ en and asked him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the first amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are giving .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , re@@ porters and sources can be less and less hidden .
instead of spl@@ itting and ris@@ king his statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secretly worried about his telephone calls ,
just like his email , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the next environmental colleague who aler@@ ts us to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the greatest data leak of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; revealed that &#91; we have hidden enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trail of 2 billion US dollars is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from childhood days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were not so many prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data sheet from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some U.S. states require less information to provide less information in order to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here in Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator claimed to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all until a lawyer made our investigation as he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers contacted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
it may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen proposals for more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind this .
representatives of both parties have t@@ abled a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally put an end to the transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I completed my design studies I made a post sale .
a guy stayed standing in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I look at me there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed and slept at the toe of the toe at the door and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress became normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to a roll .
my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when you visit .
via the Internet , they can then invite people of the game to spend the night with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we warned that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can count on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this soft touch of panic you are feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this makes most of the guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who is actually Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ elling to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give away negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests had given their assessments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they relate to age and residence .
we trust the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are telling too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing a holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that had not been met before .
for us , business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to be parties or apartments rav@@ aged .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller has always been and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , overnight stays aver@@ aged 123 million were only a fraction of a problem .
for people have confidence in one another .
if trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one thing right .
you go to the hospital in your own car if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet made from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub @-@ pent@@ our neighborhood of which you never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we were to create apartments from the ground up for sharing ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about each time when a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
of course , we know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the check @-@ up check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ annab@@ e @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my hat @-@ cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of femin@@ ism for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made an increase with the Quran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I read it , thought , put into question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow abandon that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves , you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and listened to : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; Middle Eastern ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; is bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country has been attacked , but in N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- when we went sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ low in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t get on with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day that Muslims gather together for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people who were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck free .
there were really surge in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked the country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic Games .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America more secure ?
there may be some parking lots , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as I told me a director of the police in the Washington area , DC recently : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , it does not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque kept them from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neurological studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows : if you report reviews of Muslims in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more likely to have military attacks against Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only a matter of explaining himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , as well as Yus@@ or &apos;s sister , Raz@@ an , who was visiting her in the afternoon .
he shot on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw left me holding .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and commanded our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study on Muslims worldwide , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities around the world .
before air pack@@ et order penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they started to fly with ropes .
by connecting flying devices , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space .
you can also build independently drau@@ ght resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of possible within the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available in the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most starter motors , it can float and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s ok .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that join together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying machines , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies work with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have the sle@@ ek algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly .
the odds of throwing it right when all watch is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in comfort , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its direction .
as a result , it receives the exceptional ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be set in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
once aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit constra@@ ined .
we will now demonstrate this by making half @-@ f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us is the wage in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns changed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , it sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
it was about 1.3 billion years ago that it had just been a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometric gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved detection performance .
that is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent issues .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ cked through the earth through the earth .
you went through me and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ cre@@ tion in the fabric of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other st@@ out .
lec@@ turers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ oked when hitting the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is to say 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucleus of a nucleus exactly . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it is different with tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least Lig@@ o is the measured frequency in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass that turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful , and we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own g@@ lowing .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if I was nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , in an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I wa@@ ver@@ ed to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ wing saved my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things are going to get you alive .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather around my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are leading a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dreaming with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops as painting on a canvas .
as if you have a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable .
there is such a change in me when the work runs well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the sum -- when I started working and working and doing , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot strive differently than according to size .
the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called hum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know only that I &apos;m not going to fail , and I just know that I love the hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things are happening simultaneously , the more I write history , the more I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their M@@ om is a single working institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um@@ my will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , you love to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the hum@@ ming when you know the hum@@ ming , when the hum@@ ming stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are being made aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she no longer calls anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and mo@@ urn my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the lack of bo@@ unding , I can &apos;t do anything except fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ bs and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum , the work sums , the titanium @-@ sums , that is only the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
true tot@@ als depend on love .
the tot@@ als are the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real summ@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing is not at all important to me as we work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we broke off soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreaming .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need not .
everyone can bring up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood tag !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for their peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about fun ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I won and I &apos;ll be victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes per piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming then seems to return if I do not work .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
I &apos;m not sure that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the country I create , the marathon , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the tot@@ als , the other , the right amounts : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; cereb@@ ell@@ ar stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s who suffered under severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trauma will s@@ me@@ ar the brain and increase the pressure of the skull .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull pressure .
to do this , one sometimes has to remove a part s@@ wollen base of the brain .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to make them prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slow and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they preserved ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear , however , -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we face a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we ri@@ pped them at the removal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ graph .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we ri@@ pped the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and mat@@ ured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been mat@@ ured .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original capacity before the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we rei@@ m@@ bled the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore it in man .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy wan@@ es with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my humble friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are wrong , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
because without democracy our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit @-@ parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that is part of the high net worth savers and corporations , but who are too afraid to invest it there where it would be productive and contribute income to produce the debt and also produce all the things that humanity needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the euro zone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen US Dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and increase the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand that encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes circumstances leading to o@@ edi@@ pus killing him .
this is my problem with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it drew up the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they allowed them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of state authority .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long --
like a candle that lights very bright , it is quickly burned out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was introduced to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is shifted from politics to the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my veins with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have dec@@ im@@ ated so last@@ ingly the animals they feed on , that they end up star@@ ving in the end .
it is similar to the economy that has so far advanced politics that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains the control as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summ@@ its higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
we must therefore re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines serve the human beings and humans are in the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital comes from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour are completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no exchange of exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin summ@@ its .
in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &apos; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do we not do that , technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally confused .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not mad , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the or@@ ators you have clearly told what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the area of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I dare say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West did in the nineteenth century , cried tremend@@ ously according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal perspective , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continual denial that a massive fault line through the euro@@ zone proc@@ eeded , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal to reveal this denial --
unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro@@ group , have continued to cast the denial .
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or Minister , who stays in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the liberal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most people have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is CEO at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought one .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows are given this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ts , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium output , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , what parts you skip over or look at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha house , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha house lands at 7.5 -- something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , thus the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it was suddenly no longer working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data abo@@ unds into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , you disman@@ tle this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do that several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to compose parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but deciding on how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data are saying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Ques@@ tion , you just shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened in retro@@ sp@@ ect to the ball .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off , making decisions is an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
