<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally translated drafts for a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government had ascertained Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are giving.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can be less and less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of splitting and risking his statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly worried about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email, financial and banking information, his credit, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to bring misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental colleague who alerts us to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the greatest data leak of the story was published.] [the Panama Papers "revealed that [we have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca saying:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trail of 2 billion US dollars is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent's writer or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were not so many prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data sheet from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some U.S. states require less information to provide less information in order to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here in Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator claimed to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all until a lawyer made our investigation as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers contacted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very melancholy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen proposals for more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind this.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have tabled a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and are committed to ending this kind of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally put an end to the transparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies I made a post sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy stayed standing in the red Mazda and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I look at me there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed and slept at the toe of the toe at the door and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress became normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and founded so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and me stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to a roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former mate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website that people post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite people of the game to spend the night with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We warned that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can count on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you are feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This makes most of the guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who is actually Al Gore's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channelling to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told him where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give away negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests had given their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they relate to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you are telling too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing a holiday with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to be parties or apartments ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller has always been and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, overnight stays averaged 123 million were only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one thing right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car if you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet made from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub-pentour neighborhood of which you never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to create apartments from the ground up for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about each time when a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the check-up check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my hat-cover.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of feminism for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>

<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and listened to:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam...,... "Middle Eastern ancestry..."... "Djihad..."... "is bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country has been attacked, but in Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- when we went silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">"" "when will we get rid of it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, responders and Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a director of the police in the Washington area, DC recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from her community, even from her family, so that the extremists may make a brainwashing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology in their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one looks at them, it does not exaggerate what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque kept them from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you report reviews of Muslims in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more likely to have military attacks against Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective innocence, it is not only a matter of explaining himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did such a young man come from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting her in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw left me holding.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and commanded our guests, because half of the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say you are a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a posh thought factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say deceive yourself. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest study on Muslims worldwide, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want wealth for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet order penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flying devices, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently draught resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of possible within the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available in the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter motors, it can float and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's ok.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying machines, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies work with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or controller surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the sleek algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The odds of throwing it right when all watch is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in comfort, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the exceptional ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be set in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">Once aircraft are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit constrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half-flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the wage in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns changed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, it shone brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">It was about 1.3 billion years ago that it had just been a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometric gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent issues.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves rocked through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through me and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observatories. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a concretion in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and the other stout.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses for the theory of relativity often lead to a really albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous,.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stoked when hitting the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is to say 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured in less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus exactly. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is Alice talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least Ligo is the measured frequency in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been dealing with for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender of the sound] Somebody who knows what to hear knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass that turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful, and we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Big Bang is covered by its own glowing.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo watching them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sour cherries for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of which I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if I was nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, in an unexpected way. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest one, calls all" "" "kitten," "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my" "" "beak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I wavered to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "sawing saved my career with my children." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things are going to get you alive.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather around my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are leading a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say that it's not about dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as painting on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you have a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I started working and working and doing, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you cannot strive differently than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called humming.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "I know only that I'm not going to fail, and I just know that I love the humming." ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things are happening simultaneously, the more I write history, the more I write history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the humming, the humming, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overloaded, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their Mom is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mummy will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you are working, you love to be a teacher, to be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the humming when you know the humming, when the humming stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are being made aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she no longer calls anyone" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and mourn my humming, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the lack of bounding, I can't do anything except fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crabs and the song in which it's about letting go or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sum, the work sums, the titanium-sums, that is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True totals depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real summing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">"" "" "" "playing is not at all important to me as we work." ""</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We broke off soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive, for a daydreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter speaks with me for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring up for 15 minutes, even in a bad mood tag!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for their peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the humming then seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>

<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the best known, the "cerebellar stimulation." thereby, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's who suffered under severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that skull-brain trauma will smear the brain and increase the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, one sometimes has to remove a part swollen base of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to make them prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We face a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we ripped them at the removal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autograph.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we ripped the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and matured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been matured.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original capacity before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimbled the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore it in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy wanes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my humble friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are wrong, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are brighter, our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit-paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that is part of the high net worth savers and corporations, but who are too afraid to invest it there where it would be productive and contribute income to produce the debt and also produce all the things that humanity needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the euro zone, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billionen US Dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and increase the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand that encourages the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes circumstances leading to oedipus killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my problem with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy based on these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athenian democracy was and is that it drew up the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they allowed them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of state authority.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy has not lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was introduced to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually undermining politics and dismayed it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is shifted from politics to the economy and the areas are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my veins with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of carnivores that have decimated so lastingly the animals they feed on, that they end up starving in the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has so far advanced politics that it harms itself by the self-induced economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism drives the" "" "demos" "" "out of democracy, the higher the twin summits and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains the control as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain their position in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summits higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must therefore reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that in "Matrix," in which machines serve the human beings and humans are in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like Utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital comes from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour are completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no exchange of exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin summits.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos' -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in green" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trash of history, and Keynesian, Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is..." "" "Do we not do that, technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers described as" "" "long-term stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not mad, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the orators you have clearly told what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the area of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I dare say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West did in the nineteenth century, cried tremendously according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal perspective, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to complacency and the continual denial that a massive fault line through the eurozone proceeded, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to cast the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live life through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">For example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or Minister, who stays in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the lenders' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>

<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post-modern 1930, what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most people have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is CEO at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelhairstyle and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought one.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows are given this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicts, where, after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium output, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out things for nothing, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, what parts you skip over or look at again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha house," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha house lands at 7.5 -- something above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, thus the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it was suddenly no longer working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data abounds into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you dismantle this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do that several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to compose parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete to then make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but deciding on how to put all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data are saying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question, you just shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened in retrospect to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is smarter and smarter and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off, making decisions is an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
