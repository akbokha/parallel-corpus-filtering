Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where te@@ ens are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is excav@@ ated now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the ru@@ sty ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows , who had to get upset , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you don &apos;t recognize as such .
maps , so @-@ called scrip@@ ted sheets , were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French Army Chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally withdrawn from Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a covering Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph advanced the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gaz@@ elle Journal belongs to the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created , so 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : in the zoom @-@ out there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ in numbered fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are not farmers there anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century , and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or on the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was responsible for the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and finished , for example , the purchase of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum , Munich @-@ Ost , is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was constructed - in an architectural style based on the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the ground@@ work and the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn railway line took place .
with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen rights group published Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of question@@ able , fast @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; says the group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeted towards minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning issued by the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no longer any gasoline during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being charged with a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring in Kau@@ tions@@ geld or let the relatives know they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported in 2015 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the criminal crime report program of the FBI , who classi@@ fy the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Projekt is a success @-@ project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac , have provided a picture on site .
at the right @-@ hand cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Ort joined together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insight into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five dwell@@ ings holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area cares for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not lead to bio@@ gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader &apos;s funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the exhibition area thus amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total costs amounted to € 71 500 , half of which was promoted over leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ sp@@ fle@@ gui@@ deline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest mandatory .
the prerequisite is the presence of a production set marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the f@@ enced area may not be detri@@ mental to smu@@ g@@ gling ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
for the f@@ isher &apos;s bacher project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els is currently underway , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the open @-@ air area covers 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy anymore ?
now the white House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sor@@ ely staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty ships would have sm@@ ashed him if he had done it .
but he gra@@ bbed its meaning and , in particular , the importance of it when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta con@@ jured up , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely , the miserable death of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller esp@@ ous@@ ed himself not in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict to the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the road to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered here .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognize .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the road , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner of the street .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ riff - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is elected by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , which will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at its fifth world championships , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was supposed to watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also the med@@ als and the finals will be mixed .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chosen me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Scot@@ sman who are part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to go on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world cup .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t ask for a public office if you cannot tolerate foreign elec@@ tors
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he kno@@ cked in the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with its voters and to deb@@ its its hair@@ less head for chemotherapy on its side .
this is why the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars , unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a tro@@ lle .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked about hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are rather dis@@ regarded by some as a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor designated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when we have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County has injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ e had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ cases beat upon his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on home comfort at Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an is hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led up to the final round next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field links before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Canadian @-@ based player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t be able to defend Extre@@ ma@@ dura open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad about how it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer dead due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
back then , there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hous@@ ings prove to be very complex
the construction works in the v@@ ill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s head of the building .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because there is a lot of hide in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction work again and again , represents a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , it does not use a cooker .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reign in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally lays a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the Stol@@ le is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ less space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned a field .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public lifting in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Papua , Indonesia is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port made gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million to local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden g@@ ents and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500,000 deaths have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ ishing Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Erz@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric hits are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week events happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ een sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tasted the native Papua - m@@ ama @-@ m@@ ama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ arot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they were supposed to turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers killed their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was so severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting gu@@ sts and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and a bird song im@@ itated - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to hur@@ l stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the imminent danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who just wore a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said reports that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto had a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such alleg@@ ations with grim un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people of Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having buried the dead , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday , Indonesian police fired on villa@@ gers in the nearby Dei@@ y@@ ai neighborhood .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on his way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injuries were quickly delivered here , thus the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on the participating officers to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ pedi@@ ment to the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and D@@ al , who live in the green lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flights to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Executive of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , deputy director of Asia &apos;s Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign to raise the limits of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has yet another presidential election , but the Papua says that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims conducted a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never get justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living quarters in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is called the tor@@ ch tower accidentally .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and shou@@ ting people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can rein@@ vigor@@ ate questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 found that the biggest part of the damage from facing , outer casing for decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City session , the Davis Cup sing@@ ular was not supported by the two @-@ third majority for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single @-@ han@@ de@@ dly .
those often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ pack classics are still preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership does not have embra@@ ced the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
even before the vote , the proposal had already come to pass the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey out
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of items banned by the US Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled by at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they accidentally bore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been late to discover that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by Jet Charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
those surve@@ yed admitted that they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ mined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose extra@@ dition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the United States and £ 1000 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation conversion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non@@ com@@ mitt@@ al reservations pre@@ tend , Mus@@ k cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe that the cancellation of up to now around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be assembled - 500,000 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of the year 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never before tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules on reducing emissions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew its previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period running on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ te announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ te has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation that resist@@ ed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ pa regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane le@@ aks .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ te suggested that his turn @-@ around in o@@ zone standards simply ampli@@ fied the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others , and set the date for implementation in an agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ te will sometime make use of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available enforcement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had accused the EPA during this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g flowing into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the free smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ sion &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to tackle environmental pollution and its particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tumours Celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ kirche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm is invited to a seren@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the 6th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ bling to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was first mentioned in records in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Docum@@ entation : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the wor@@ ding of the certificate was based on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ al Law belonged and not the other way around .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Upper Austrian town of Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the beautiful sett@@ ler nucleus of the village .
old maps , dating back to 1600 , under@@ pin these historical realities .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two destroyed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell sets were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops came near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remnants of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half r@@ ushed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune the tower was broken off .
only today &apos;s tower @-@ mill remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultivating the Hil@@ arius plant by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ er Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers , the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen , on Sunday 16th July , invite the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is organised by the com@@ bo of the German Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium in Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the author Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
for the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers discover the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ bling and hearing @-@ welding .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association wants to have permission from wind turbines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invited Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind@@ power concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are princip@@ ally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a missing form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval letter is still illegal and therefore withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided against the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it impossible for the establishment of wind power plants to be granted at this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since last week the corresponding letters have been dealt with by the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter .
however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the current proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four wind turbines at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had made lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity consumption is expected to be covered by around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ burner households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible road accident happened on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were injured easily .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ n@@ ch travelled to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and Tra@@ der are planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ an and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the business association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce residents to the shopping expedition to the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city aside from the usual supermarket goods .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ attended Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be opened new or re @-@ opened .
this includes guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city center when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly had spread , had told King in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared that five Thurin@@ gian cities took part in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local commerce and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her purchasing behaviour directly .

only a few people stayed at the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy in the holiday season .
tru@@ mp reli@@ ed on the le@@ aks of telephone calls from Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and drivers of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp rang out in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president ap@@ plau@@ ded him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and sw@@ am to pay Mexico for the project .
his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; depot &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists led rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury came through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and caught the Ford @-@ Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped forward with ri@@ fl@@ es to block their way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the passengers flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged away from the passenger seat .
luckily , this horrible scene played on July 22 was just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience hit a very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ o@@ thy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been retri@@ eved by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps to organize the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice never has been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff presents a blanket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI reports received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the bare feet for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court of Georgia made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , black Far@@ mers Roger Mal@@ com dropped a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ o@@ thy and that the baby that she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ o@@ thy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got closer to the prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and distorted the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election rally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Moore Ford &apos;s Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and is based on a kind of deep racism , of which many want to believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ven Co @-@ Director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester cries and hu@@ gs him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ o@@ thy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Raz@@ oli reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Mr. Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still sti@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and right there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition stops violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with mour@@ ning , stands over the body of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie Holidays with mour@@ ning &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York to see the performance , many just come down the street .
for almost eight hours they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as cr@@ ushing humidity when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse .
children sit on their heads , record the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy than he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the im@@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today the only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is somehow inspiring because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner in Bayreuth &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f uses a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine hum@@ idi@@ fiers pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels evo@@ ke Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine bo@@ aters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess seduc@@ es her with Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , who in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier pul@@ ls a cor@@ pse into the trunk and give the Ri@@ stor@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously fe@@ ather@@ ed Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight @-@ box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with great applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ce and conductor Jan@@ owski are solem@@ n@@ ly celebrated , who hum@@ bles himself and de@@ fle@@ cts his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in light of the great heat in casual wear @-@ clothes .
the performance by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team team was eag@@ erly awaited .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ lowing pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were interrupted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been looking forward to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it is also an understanding of his view .
I draw a positive resume .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places during their volunteer years .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in stone belt at the furniture fair , once a week I will work here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at the school in the open day @-@ all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing ?
do a social year , there is an insight when you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
lot : sure , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating extras .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - one must always go into it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
a lot : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that .
Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce additional 3,000 jobs and cut her interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job reductions announced by General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by the rapid pace to digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , sharing an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement of NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; man @-@ sponsored impro@@ vised explosive . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and the police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are oblig@@ ated to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states accused the agency for their step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA , Scott P@@ ru@@ mp in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and Nature Protection Groups , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ ate wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ ori@@ us Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time until the area of the church is now owned by the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square metres for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are suspended , such a common space not to be seen as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ able living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , will be compensated by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal &apos;s proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not necessary to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which are le@@ aning against the surrounding build @-@ up - would be possible , as well as a pul@@ sed roof , which would reduce the height of the pump and make the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean this additive .
when it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously to the panel .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not go so well , but now they rest in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to any property or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in the case of doubt .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to submit the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we capture the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with a car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and seriously injured .
as the police said , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike trail of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder rode on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t care about the traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a retreat car .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ra
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals miss the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al Win@@ ner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , personnel care at the German Football @-@ Record Champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his crew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know we &apos;re not in the best physical shape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also a tactic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights ev@@ ades the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the Harz Mountains to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should arise in the resin in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information for many of the visitor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ Path train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star appeared more strongly than another , although it lies much further away .
you will also learn which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university city there has been something similar to the planned star@@ light - the planet path since 2003 on the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ a@@ es up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a 6.5 milli@@ metre diameter ball , while the sun that is exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , it takes a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march towards the next fixation , however , would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko come for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future , came under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion that went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ year World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple pose for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move on lightweight divi@@ ders &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Por@@ osh@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be based on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed candi@@ dly to fight with the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ class champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ exit . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to tire rup@@ ture
four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock just before the junction of Markt@@ breit .
the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , afterwards traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping to win the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig after 2 : 2 that optimi@@ zes defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as though not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ dimensional chain is also to be further optimized .
and a gate after a collision , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one puts on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experiences in preparation with the triple @-@ chain than with the four @-@ se@@ ater .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start after a tie , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I first judge the season after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted early because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors from the Rhin@@ eland will be a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we put them away , just because we have the right to go among the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results from the Swedish Asyl@@ um App@@ lic@@ ants &apos; Test published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ k@@ et ) have started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or older , while in 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results of 5@@ 81 , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work covers the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is very low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is close to 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the road and traffic department of the Fri@@ bourg Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three re@@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven tonnes of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special t@@ act feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collector &apos;s pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked .
the cost of the three fra@@ ctions is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull at one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the power day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad coalition that shows peac@@ efully on that day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and familiar names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well place , but now takes place in the parking area below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forums &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One World and one of the major organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Eifel report that he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ i there were not enough parking places available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ age is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it does : at about 20 p.m. a band for entertainment provides a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Boy .
in the audi@@ torium there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t , have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ union with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
they both combine the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new winner , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ gger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix together to a fascinating total artwork . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the fa@@ th@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I have ever had .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten said she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them they suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to stay in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have dist@@ anced themselves from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in che@@ er .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal store from his father .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country magnificent again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader in athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ises on Thursday what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin , said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the elimination of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were taken away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress will support the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers killed in Mali
at a funeral service in Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
as a matter of fact , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this supreme sacrifice that they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday was accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral celebration in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Inspec@@ tor of the German Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
roses laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Defense Minister of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sh@@ attered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the aircraft of the helicopter &apos;s Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; if the crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali not shown Minist@@ erial of the Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik is not trying to find a tomb next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already completed a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue in the communication .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Char@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after his death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokesperson for the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were constantly restra@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to reti@@ re after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the Parliament &apos;s resolution spoke out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens party from its state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Monday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover was losing its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his Group to take it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio is revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable for the Land@@ tag to quickly decide its self @-@ resolution .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament chooses the trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be properly checked by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ West costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their bit@@ tern@@ ess and fru@@ stration are their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty tricks and tries to strike out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses the contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in the interview with the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is virtually impossible .
is Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since announ@@ cing the dis@@ agreement of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just as the manufacturers are concerned , retailers must ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual stress levels of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , they are not capable of transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production companies are not directly responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is too little control in the case of a serious incident .
is there only a lack of personal or a conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made it clear already several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the pan@@ elled means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moves to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues from the European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfers from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G at some point must prove that the N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to under@@ write and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate entry sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their activities on football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively frau@@ dul@@ ently and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners pulled back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , used by Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen out of favor of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue for the next five years can be reported to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a financial penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA sponsor@@ ing was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come through payments from the Qatar Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be ambass@@ adors and that such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot@@ erie sales .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s om@@ is@@ sion by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or different interests can have when a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss francs .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small , mic@@ rot@@ ated chocolate tablets of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; north@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious job .
the Swiss will not want to disclose how many applicants are in the new ten@@ dering process .
but only Swiss manufacturers question this question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006 .
prior to signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if the time was short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly worked well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for promising lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by ste@@ aling at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - nevertheless , they managed to win back the last part of the seat .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy works more after the watering @-@ kann@@ a principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That Fo@@ ols the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character goes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ evil plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ usion that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his east @-@ west bull@@ fighting icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ a ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an ingenious idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the ver@@ acity of a desperate &quot; propaganda drama &quot; - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ arranged to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can make everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators lay not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart many objects were searched for , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared Constance on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in the southern German area .
there was a lively exchange between the prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the Ban@@ de bank account .
Weise be@@ mo@@ cks big gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the German foreign register lacks substantial short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions concerning asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has pointed to large gaps in the country of foreigners in the country of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in a way that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
because the data have not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data of 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , EU citizens are included in statistics on sufficient people who do not have to travel abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such incorrect orders , however , led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with adequate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF can perform such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except infants and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was under reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to its own country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees to the reception and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threaten human illegal reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all of them are Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation hon@@ ours the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could profit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enbach reported on the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 spin @-@ offs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district commission@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a moved to the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded each 50 performed blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but she sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be needed to rein the inflation fired from Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs could possibly increase more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting next February , although it has been said that now it is expected to provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scale than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound after these messages fell from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rate of interest and GDP in the second quarter climbed from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and marginal revenue , as tigh@@ tening is even worse before it gets better .
she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent the income tax , &quot; but she added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast can be &quot; significantly &quot; recovered .
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August , following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the loss of the fun@@ nel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for a rate of interest was higher , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers rising to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has declined from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the exceeding ratio to its target of 2 % was attributed to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again as the len@@ ders are clam@@ ouring for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is especially good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to permit registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .
pre@@ disposition proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment belong to gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants will identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was taken , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , a shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne ter@@ rac@@ ce - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled En@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge M@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars made by Jo@@ anne .
the perception of a glam@@ orous room allows the beauty of the living room to close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter @-@ important so that when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of something standard in something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave these .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument about one of the largest real estate imperial Victoria worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a point of issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business , from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but rather raises Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ ke family .
Col@@ in says that he began there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current controversy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , conven@@ ed at his first working day with executive employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relation to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was upset about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to stop Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady pra@@ ising price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s ok .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign function@@ aries know something else we don &apos;t know , that without their intervention Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees managed to keep him away from him for several times , their efforts paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented the emergence of Tru@@ mp controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp Material that may possibly promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - fully engaged in this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to bring question@@ able information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ prov@@ ok@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp was reading the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold @-@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is raised and hoped .
the police across Europe sent post cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , information from the population will be raised and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the campaign following the winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience would have shown that many fle@@ eting spots are hiding on holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been viewed by www.@@ e@@ um@@ .@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could so far be arrested , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of war that have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch pulled by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were only tos@@ sed out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents attacked the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced through shame on implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local fee if the Council does not even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them on as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour at the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made from Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is formed from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and is to be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has long been a building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly degra@@ ded , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread widely , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Director of Tourism Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the high level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relying on people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper read the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N channel reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the council in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to systematically intervene in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ can Guard in the campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also magni@@ fied more and more Tru@@ mp private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the Special Agent Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the centre and asked whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ciary due to the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether accus@@ ation should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called indic@@ t@@ tings .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people under oath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting had been invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. there were also Tru@@ mp advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp &apos;s concern .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the demo@@ crats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a grand jury .
but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the Special Agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that he was not determined against the president .
there is no reason to believe that something has changed since it was stated in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root ej@@ ection , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for setting up investigations against the National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n at that time .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House acquired material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an Independent Special Issu@@ er of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented the bill on Thursday that the special agent could not be released so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the big col@@ os@@ sus via a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometer drive now to the north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 km , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to researchers , it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking down the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swim in the sea and is fed by big glaciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this cow@@ ard@@ stick , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ orts was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
a complete ice shelf can be broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I &apos;m talking about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s are in danger , because the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and force ice as much water as it gives after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , albeit only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the polar shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat ever since the records began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists say whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not lead to the dis@@ ruption of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ice @-@ gro@@ unders of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past few decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to a decrease .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus ranks among the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
at the end of the summer break , 41 new jobs have been linked to administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be published this year .
nonetheless , the circle is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are no vac@@ ant positions in M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to join the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross entry and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
so the t@@ all@@ est time to take action so that there will be no more places un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he already caused a lazy surprise already in the gy@@ ro @-@ day , when he publicly asked the personnel costs cover and start@@ led the remaining parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we are not in a short @-@ term solution to a satisfactory solution , the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim at a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; said peoples .
so the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely stipul@@ ated , increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone to NGO @-@ migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German charity organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because the crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed alleg@@ ations made by the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I@@ u@@ vent@@ a has been monitoring since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is estimated that its crew will take ding@@ h@@ y migrants supplied directly by human traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the case of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan may@@ ors this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
recei@@ pts and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post , &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ wald forest and the up@@ stream layers .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again there was a lookout point at the lookout point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days there were a lot of altitude difference .
caves , rocks , towers , fort@@ resses , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of fighting through the stadium racing against wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first federal regulations that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to enth@@ use new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are many clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the federal government to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level .
as in normal sport , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pros are competing against each other .
and in the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding , and a rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ enced player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to carry through on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
the players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales should be at 130 million .
this is little to say about the approximately 2.4 billion euro in the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the E @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte accoun@@ tant .
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany la@@ gs behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to exp@@ ire only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter committed to suicide because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy mur@@ ders for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is dis@@ consol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have taken Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney at law said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not figure out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my sor@@ rows that we will have for eternity to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; persecuted &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn the generator down and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British resident in Italy in 2007 , was convic@@ ted before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ myself : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern scores a great season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , I saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his rush to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but k@@ im@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of vacation .
sugar is best spread to those who want to keep a lot of vegetables that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to embar@@ k on the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right side , this is its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ me had an effect in this initial formation like the one who can take the helm all the time .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ op .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal with it to re@@ play his missing fitness ( barely folded ) ; Ren@@ ato san@@ ches with it , on the devil come out of the benefits of the Asia trip ( fold also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not neg@@ atively impact on their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ myself , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ kept Nap@@ oli storm proved to be difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ familiar this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game afterwards .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said good @-@ bye to his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has been informed about Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft im Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ Request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; browsing takes up the wishes of the economy that has all blocked le@@ m@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be completed .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West H@@ ung of Trier , which is in urgent need of the federal highway plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) has stri@@ ved to use a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that has been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be given to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U faction vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country was also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey just with a note of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it cleared up the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - forbi@@ ds or restric@@ ts diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of squ@@ ashing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but to return to normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were accused , others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and therefore is not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is contributing dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message on Saturday morning .
when it comes to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and that is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft was on the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious conduct .
Mor@@ dil@@ los scar@@ f @-@ n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his hall@@ marks .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he was , among other things , a dra@@ fts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo loved many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches his dro@@ med@@ ary figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and TV series for six years with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ fold as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to reach the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
this is why it rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence critically endangered by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions of dro@@ ught and disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers try to find solutions , great headache is prepared .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered , because in recent years the plant has exposed the effects of climate change , which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf cy@@ c@@ ads , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions which are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval Festival .
dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a rural retreat are to be experienced at these days in the city center .
the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay list or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while throughout the country the bodies are pil@@ ing up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to joined forces in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing assault and threats from federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Fe@@ odo@@ sius building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings connected with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Fe@@ odo@@ z , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is still more tra@@ itor .
without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sius in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot in the street or that the gra@@ ve@@ yard is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of odo@@ sius , was bl@@ amed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the competing Kart@@ ell@@ fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up the odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without b@@ ump@@ ing on the drugs problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the establishment of odo@@ sius , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for its Cour@@ age in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take on the task that you think of as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead men ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fe@@ odo@@ sius @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ ning bird , who was able to cur@@ l like a do@@ ck@@ man , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for the routine of his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing flags , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells incorrect , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the odo@@ sius Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing has happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff from Ri@@ odo@@ bo@@ u met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sius in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who said the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters travelled to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sius made up three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending that concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost throughout the entire century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez bure@@ au was reloc@@ ated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists because the staff became something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few notes and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by putting them down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since prayed that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces , which were put under a blanket with organised crime .
over the past year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sius settled on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to hum@@ ming .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .

din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ orn of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dinosau@@ rs that has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth@@ ling .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a converting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to better interfere in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by enough pressure by eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this cam@@ el has been exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powerful car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on po@@ inters on his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ dan@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , was caught in a river and dri@@ fted out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with sh@@ red@@ ded skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only stra@@ y a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he &apos;s sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best @-@ preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that were ra@@ ging off his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept away by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the he@@ wers cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
thunder@@ storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometres long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the free@@ way Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age late Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police at 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
there is no information available about the exact number of injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction to Munich .
in the direction of travel Munich , a back@@ log of approximately ten kilometres was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade marked the mark of the vehicle makers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was another accident at A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or you are pl@@ ung@@ ed into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhaust .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ cre@@ wed or breaks the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the smooth ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers do .
you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation then appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the driver arrives at number Y for ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train esc@@ ort staff , simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marketing executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often one does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets in each case .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train esc@@ ort and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further net numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to her core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live to twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she made her cell phone to go back to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be a father &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman reas@@ sured his gun and cried out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call us typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting November 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flo@@ wer@@ dress and a fitting crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black experience and black state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on right now , because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blat@@ ant racism , she is not unlike the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give it a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after August 9th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around the To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt det@@ ain@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , together with six other local people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; followed in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ero &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ero &apos;s life , how they fall in love and marry their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin em@@ bos@@ sed the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who was stirring up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the intelligence of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the subject hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the Bit @-@ Galerie say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , from which also the remaining stores benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and ad@@ mitt@@ edly to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmers market almost a week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country@@ women always like to be very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will rise to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project might not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why buy @-@ in palaces in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains to us .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre , as the r@@ ents there are often not viable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already manage to sell all businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping centre that is empty doesn &apos;t need anybody .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall there is no room for meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the cut @-@ outs from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st has served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having secretly classified diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline imp@@ acted its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit a little intellectual commentary not only about the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six off@@ ences against the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly uncomfortable sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just hit by the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ t and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit her and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned mice became an un@@ equal bri@@ efs , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s illustrated book &quot; Supp@@ ressing Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future that would transform President Chel@@ mos verdict and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome way of happy meeting .
there is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid circuits he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in graph@@ ite .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what hopefully will bring people with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a hands @-@ free spy in hand from the disciplinary box of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they cold your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulator which assem@@ bles like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also purpos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , man &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University due to murder
a country@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ anen ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the bul@@ ls as murder while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects said officials .
since 2007 , she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that it was now being lau@@ ded and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email declaration that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago &apos;s Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that they were in the building for them and waiting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ introduction of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov showed problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ ed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from carrying out dop@@ ing checks in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AS ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
that divided the company groups .
it was a mere presum@@ ption that no health impair@@ ment could be expected , it was said in the communication .
from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested on fi@@ pron@@ ged anti @-@ lice inc@@ ision .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at the e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside to help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they get a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap Sur@@ ve@@ ys and Sur@@ ve@@ ys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low appro@@ vals results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financially technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alle in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have recently registered as a client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ charts of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also provides an anonymous text message hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ ting , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Valu@@ es and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen had collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ y secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors will achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 inspir@@ ations , you need to be ready to have 4.000 votes , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen companies who have too much to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t follow employees , ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ LIN@@ T , so salvation .
and after the collection of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ru@@ by Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players are talking on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas on campus .
some have moved out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real ped@@ alling mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became a Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three exercise sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already accomplished schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood &apos;s practical exercises .
they are expected to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the N@@ CA@@ A rule change even if it adds another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load on it three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already cleared with foot@@ balls , which is a protection network behind a door@@ post , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ in players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that the people there are renting a room and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts testing in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tants that may show results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual reviews of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to be testing its feature on the &quot; related item , &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to l@@ essen the wrong messages .

&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; stretches back the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have considered my welcome greeting a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the site and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape tut@@ ors , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access to 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps depicting what was possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &quot; Kni@@ pex Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are joined together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , who hid the Dar@@ rell family for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell men solved their school crises by getting married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about E@@ lä@@ fla@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens , are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an omni@@ present promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost the new umbrella and the campaign for a mid @-@ 5 @-@ digit amount .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the discussions .
so the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number of revolutions .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired up 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who were to be directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara became involved in Ankara following this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the scar@@ f ban for female soldiers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the army and security forces carry on the army and security forces .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing a further 73@@ 95 state servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they scre@@ amed on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan backed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
ex @-@ officers say Erdo@@ gan deliberately drives an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an especially not @-@ called officer who sought asylum after the attempted put@@ sch from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this does happen , such a development could not let Nato become cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after pur@@ ging doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who have the financial means to support himself and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for race @-@ airport shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months have been argu@@ ably over the future of the racing game - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
even before the end of the year it is to be built at the mar@@ o@@ des route , on which the tourist tram is driving .
in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will start on the route according to the Ministry of Transport this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated transport secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this will enable the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle to be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partly very pe@@ eled in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny about them , but the companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have become robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as rel@@ ap@@ sing .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation , or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most .
on his website true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not last sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what is se@@ eping out of the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their creators want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp large power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have split up families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp sel@@ ectable relatives .
we all are o@@ sten@@ si@@ ly critici@@ zing all of us in order to burst our filter bags .
less notice has been the power of putting families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp actually seem to be a very mild criminal .
if Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not part of a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time .
if I could have scored the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked him .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor lady in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moves from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of inc@@ isions at his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death belt because of murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Body said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ na@@ iss@@ aries from F@@ ool and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the class@@ mates will go to school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle rising up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at the chickens erhof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle was released .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who wore cylinders to bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ leiter Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each quad@@ rup@@ ed that he felt accepted in his new school .
thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps at teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the Kü@@ ster@@ zeit is now over , the teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching her students leave classes very reluct@@ ant , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ point äss@@ ler .
finally , all students could finish a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ cler@@ ks have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Foreign Ministry reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of free camping and put on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , have substantial fin@@ es .
inspections are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission categories Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin , ACE Auto Club Europe , gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have che@@ ated software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but no exact date yet .
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the relationships depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , willingly the autom@@ akers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that don &apos;t drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tract , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp is promising to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honoured ones .
awards are awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar , which was announced with progressive TV shows , already announced that he would refrain from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the biggest cultural institution in the US capital .
former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to regular periods of dis@@ miss@@ al , it should be enough time for a famili@@ arization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Has@@ lach is acting as a lower civil authority for the administration community , the applicant must instruc@@ t corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worthy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are approxim@@ ated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a great lati@@ tude for a city building master .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gardening , much flexibility can be re@@ acted to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a listed monument , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going town building master emphasizes .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of co @-@ operative care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
according to the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should be able to show a completed degree as a diploma engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning rights .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt contains high and civil construction , construction guidance planning , municipal utility , administrative of municipal real estate , urban farm with building yard and gar@@ dener , as well as the Lower Building Law Office , including monument protection .
bike on cables thrown : South track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown criminals had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for them for the night .
near the scene of the scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike rider had been watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a gap in Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have put himself in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the installation , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , sponsors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum went out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been remedi@@ ed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the South track could be led without obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were out on Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the long @-@ haul traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains did not fall , but they had delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , approximately 200 metres of overhead cables had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a particular bacter@@ ium in their ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet more tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , who had been separated but had not had this .
they suspected that the difference with intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells were found , but without them in mice .
mice were caught in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells developed .
in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , researchers L. was@@ ter@@ i increased in a liquid and then passed small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells sank by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ able cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
when Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressed in the semi @-@ roll as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his Start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Boeing &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream@@ liner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sky &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan state Michigan and pulled out in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , social @-@ democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only a fire from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners .
since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with a growing horror .
what Schulz took from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach .
there were deep hits .
and one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising faction exit of a Gre@@ ens @-@ Euro MP pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal executive Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must return its mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election leader of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er si@@ ghs , when the new Police &apos;s Message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after passing the green dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD sovereign associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
and then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD away , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te turned the party smoothly .
in the weeks after that , the comrades ti@@ pped up again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next heart@@ beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his aura during the weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he made things wrong in the communication of crisis afterwards , what one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the League in the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l does not blame the party @-@ internal force of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know at all .
for the moment , the comrades seek to keep their own ranks .
their anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians , T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic how Ms. T@@ westen combined their own career processes on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party links in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS T@@ westen has not been voted for by its person as a direct candidate , but by the state list of the lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , according to the Lower Saxony dep@@ uties .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago were clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says op@@ per@@ mann , who is leading the SPD as the leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents the election result of a future CD@@ U member , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to elu@@ ci@@ date the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local politicians III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon receive support from the country .
on Wednesday Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives learned town development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler had a look back on what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been sensi@@ tivities in the re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy still amounted to 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to further develop interior design and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 I received the information from the District Court of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the community felt sens@@ ations .
how is a remedi@@ ation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned territory to san@@ ction .
if necessary , the territorial borders may be postpon@@ ed again .
the pon@@ to@@ on represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of interior cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding is from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the stock@@ taking would take place , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the set @-@ up must be carried out as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can be started in the coming year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality had to carry out the predicted preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective property there is also a remedi@@ al notation in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to emotions and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a key success factor for the project is the co @-@ operation of those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it works , among other things , about the structural condition and the restructuring intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , note that Got@@ zel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to development .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , warns first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event brought out by American manufacturing last month cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American design programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President , Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for running the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicop@@ ters arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o &apos;clock this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the aircraft during the time on the aircraft .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal authorities to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm identification .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Navy One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation when the presidential aircraft operated against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , a civil servant said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Sik@@ or@@ sky spokesman said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 doesn &apos;t have budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the State Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers set on the basis of estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND Study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement principles for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ men of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel with the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the still flaw@@ less balance of five games , the Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis league got the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , at any rate , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north are mainly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good deal of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ and @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman is not able to compete for the Bundes@@ liga @-@ tournament at the moment , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec is at his first bet during this season .
yesterday , the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean , Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , was at the ball yesterday with the White @-@ Russian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky and at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories , last Sunday , against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move back to the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills up the cad@@ res .
how America can damage O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really feel happy when he signed his signature under the law for tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels did not harm the US initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then investors are worried about domestic O@@ MV , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one setting is enormous .
however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would even have to bring the sanctions back to life by Executive Order .
there are twelve weapons available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the spotlight on Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s hit series
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest gu@@ sts of the show .
in the third season , the DE@@ A focused its attention on the richest organisation of the world drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a For@@ tune 500 company &quot; only with more government bri@@ ber@@ ies and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian investig@@ ators to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
reel for@@ wards : the town has 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an allocation to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal day@@ care centers .
on September 1 , Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still cooked except house : a cat@@ erer assumes this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children will be given a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 days of the week eat in the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service starting September 1st : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salads , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , clean up the meal , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen as well as the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 persons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ kel , acting head of the United Nations mission , said hundreds of women will be competing in the elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban has published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ some said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.4 million voters .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to information from the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old declined the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glasgow
a union would like to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow with managers from the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had out@@ weighed the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , manufactures Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s shop manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request to express &quot; concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the store manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react immediately , as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all of our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga would like to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar in pursuit of a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ gio back in last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ .000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans Board is insi@@ sting that the club has always given his best to take care of him since he arrived in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came to the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 7.@@ 55 p.m. in direction of Le@@ ese .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ s@@ ner , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication in relation to the German press agency , he anticipated the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ enced Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false estim@@ ation of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in reporting on violence , two measures were measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a matter of &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ ker@@ in and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we love to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ oured food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put@@ ts have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the ab@@ uses , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder tape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Brother der Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report published by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domain spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more pronounced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to many other def@@ endants , many victims under@@ estimated the overall humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen gives George R@@ atz@@ inger his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against violence against the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible when a dom@@ ed set did not perform a top performance musically .
how do you consider this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , learn about it too late or have taken first hints not taken seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also provide an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compla@@ ining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he not only kno@@ cked with chairs and threw the key@@ hole on the floor , but also pulled ear @-@ files and pulled too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys to the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know such cultivation methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
compared to what it is all about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no translations available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people who never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was a great deal about abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in connection with the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true issue in the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who , in a way , would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do you assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il wor@@ ded it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... books are more urgent or clearer or more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report comes to the clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to be acqu@@ itted of all co @-@ ordination .
that way he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an adver@@ t .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must he live with this accus@@ ation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leader of the Cathedral cats .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been brut@@ ally har@@ assed and painted , all of them in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims admired the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently give ear to the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when audi@@ ts had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that they happened to be in a legal grey area , as everyone of us probably knows .
for him it was difficult to estimate , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .

only in 1980 the death penalty was officially abol@@ ished at schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the danger of assessing the past after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally being worked up .
but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his time of Regensburg has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger quoted in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also speak to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not even admit that there was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding an unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an Institution of Wel@@ fare , true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and can@@ dies , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys do not have a great singer and every success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experienced during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamentally good , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something in a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen date , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until now that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but it was also a loving respect for respect to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once more clearly : all you are propos@@ ing are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published will relieve him .
now the An@@ t would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and maybe even Germany , no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
