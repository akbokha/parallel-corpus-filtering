<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where teens are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is excavated now for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the rusty ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows, who had to get upset, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a strabypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that you don't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Maps, so-called scripted sheets, were incorporated into the large map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army Chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally withdrawn from Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph advanced the project further, founded the" "" "Topographische Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Gazelle Journal belongs to the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: in the zoom-out there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-in numbered flurries from the so-called "urine" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots are not farmers there anymore - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sonne" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century, and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or on the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was responsible for the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the purchase of so-called" "" "Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum, Munich-Ost, is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesanum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was constructed - in an architectural style based on the original building of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the groundwork and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn railway line took place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen rights group published Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farming has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of questionable, fast-based occurrences occur throughout the state and can be noted here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that are disproportionately targeted towards minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning issued by the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people pass." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no longer any gasoline during the journey by the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being charged with a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring in Kautionsgeld or let the relatives know they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported in 2015 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the criminal crime report program of the FBI, who classify the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of residential or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholder groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidefence-Projekt is a success-project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac, have provided a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-hand cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Ort joined together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insight into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five dwellings holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area cares for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to biogas.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader's funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The exhibition area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total costs amounted to €71 500, half of which was promoted over leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landschaftspfleguideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a production set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area may not be detrimental to smuggling (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisher's bacher project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently underway, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area covers 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the white House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sorely staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty ships would have smashed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed its meaning and, in particular, the importance of it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta conjured up, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely, the miserable death of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable drop" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller espoused himself not in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict to the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neoconservatives that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the road to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh encountered here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the road, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>

<seg id="178">This is why the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars, unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew its previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>

<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumbling to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuschapel was first mentioned in records in the Wuerttemberg Documentation: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the certificate was based on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the Patronal Law belonged and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Upper Austrian town of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the local picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the beautiful settler nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps, dating back to 1600, underpin these historical realities.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two destroyed at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bell sets were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops came near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today's tower-mill remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity consumption is expected to be covered by around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-burner households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer doesn't mean this additive.</seg>

<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet.</seg>

<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the StarPath train will be extended by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, such as the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.</seg>
<seg id="810">In addition, they learned why stars had different colors, or why a star appeared more strongly than another, although it lies much further away.</seg>
<seg id="811">You will also learn which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>

<seg id="817">The stelaes with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">The earth shrinks to a 6.5 millimetre diameter ball, while the sun that is exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.</seg>

<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age evaluation, where X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work covers the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going super," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the road and traffic department of the Fribourg Government." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three rebuilding bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30m wide and seven tonnes of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal attachment, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger firm Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special tact feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collector's pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three fractions is 700 000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars moves to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues from the European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfers from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG at some point must prove that the Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to underwrite and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counteract with legitimate entry sources that allow them the break-even point in their activities on football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively fraudulently and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners pulled back their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen out of favor of the Presidency in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared with The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue for the next five years can be reported to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a financial penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsoring was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the Qatar Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup will be ambassadors and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">Previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymar's arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricoterie sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers, and she tried to prevent Neymars omission by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels as if the time was short.</seg>

<seg id="1190">At one point, a character goes through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost its virginity.</seg>

<seg id="1195">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippage of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random delusion that could incite this franchise as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminded of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War by "The Americans," on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his east-west bullfighting iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tata (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to see (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the veracity of a desperate "propaganda drama" - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was rearranged to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terracce - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Enfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars made by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">The perception of a glamorous room allows the beauty of the living room to close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went inside," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counter-important so that when you push the door, it is very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love yourself in the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of something standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave these.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument about one of the largest real estate imperial Victoria worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul approximately one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a point of issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business, from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but rather raises Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeanske family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claims that mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul" "" "says about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much" "" "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, convened at his first working day with executive employees, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relation to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from places that were to convince," "" "said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote in the time that" "" "the key to stop Trump's Twitter habit, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praising price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's ok.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign functionaries know something else we don't know, that without their intervention Trump Tweets would have included even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"" "" "" "if his employees managed to keep him away from him for several times, their efforts paid off." ""</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented the emergence of Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may possibly promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - fully engaged in this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to bring questionable information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff of Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had voiced false allegations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump was reading the article and began to ask staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold-maker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most wanted criminals receive post from Europol</seg>
<seg id="1419">Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is raised and hoped.</seg>

<seg id="1429">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-to-do street from Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only tossed out in May without being deterred by a ditch dug by the council in order to prevent their seizures.</seg>

<seg id="1444">Waldhotel Luise is made from Birkenhof</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is formed from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is to be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed in the council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The former Hotel Birkenhof has long been a building container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly degraded, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should be" "" "pretty bourgeois" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"" "" "" "we want to make a piece of jewellery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread widely, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause he has already led, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the high level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under a million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The exterior installations are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal" "" "relying on people" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper read the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN channel reported that there are already first invitations of the council in connection with a meeting between Trump eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to systematically intervene in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican Guard in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also magnified more and more Trump private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "a few weeks ago, the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote that the Special Agent Trump had personally moved to the centre and asked whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary due to the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether accusation should be made." ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called indicttings.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "according to the" "" "CNN" "", "charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting had been invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trump advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his leader Paul Manafort in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the implementation of the Gremidium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump's concern.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the Russian history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the topic gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good," "" "because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a grand jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses any measures that hastened the work of the Special Agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey told three times that he was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to believe that something has changed since it was stated in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this root ejection, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for setting up investigations against the National Security Adviser Michael Flynn at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House acquired material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an Independent Special Issuer of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "but several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step." ""</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented the bill on Thursday that the special agent could not be released so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swim in the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this cowardstick, the balance of waxes and aborts was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf can be broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I'm talking about the fact that the Larsen-C Schelfeis are in danger, because the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and force ice as much water as it gives after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, albeit only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the polar shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat ever since the records began," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists say whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not lead to the disruption of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many ice-grounders of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to a decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus ranks among the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">At the end of the summer break, 41 new jobs have been linked to administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nonetheless, the circle is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are no vacant positions in Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to join the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross entry and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">It sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a real" "" "contest of the public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So the tallest time to take action so that there will be no more places unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter nations, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already caused a lazy surprise already in the gyro-day, when he publicly asked the personnel costs cover and startled the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we are not in a short-term solution to a satisfactory solution, the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim at a Haustarif," said peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">So the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently precisely stipulated, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone to NGO-migrant lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," "" "said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German charity organization 'Youth Rettet' because the crew had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">"" "the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of" "" "Youth Rettet" "" "which Iuventa has been monitoring since October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is estimated that its crew will take dinghy migrants supplied directly by human traffickers and that smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the case of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian coastguard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organisation is doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin Outpost," and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North-Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through the stadium racing against wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaits included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "we have also recognized the first federal regulations that are increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the federal government to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros are competing against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and take care of the diet.</seg>

<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobber also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes more and more an issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to carry through on online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the road internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales should be at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little to say about the approximately 2.4 billion euro in the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte accountant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Internationally, many countries are already on the move.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has exposed the effects of climate change, which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's pay list or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies are piling up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined forces in December 2012. 589 are facing assault and threats from federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Feodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Feodosius building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder prosecutor's office was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings connected with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Feodoz, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is still more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosius in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelfth flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot in the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of odosius, was blamed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the competing Kartellfractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up the odoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without bumping on the drugs problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of odosius, she received prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its Courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Feodosius-Team misses Valdez, the spawning bird, who was able to curl like a dockman, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask:" "" "was his love for the routine of his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells incorrect, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the odosius Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing has happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff from Riodobou met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days earlier it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodosius in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who said the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters travelled to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodosius made up three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending that concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost throughout the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The Valdez bureau was relocated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the killings of journalists because the staff became something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few notes and went to a demonstration in the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since prayed that she is re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, which were put under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Over the past year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 lbs. (1,100 kg) heavy earthling.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a converting tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to better interfere in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by eating carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this camel has been exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on pointers on his life, including his conserved Dardanhaltes, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armoured dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that were raging off his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept away by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after arriving in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2030">She made her cell phone to go back to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police tape and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be a father's father who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman reassured his gun and cried out," "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flowerdress and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had" "" "black experience and black state" "" "countless times before this morning." ""</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give it a bad service to keep it away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived at Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism completely changed after August 9th," "" "she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell in mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around the Todestrakt detainees.</seg>
<seg id="2064">"" "his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other local people," "" "Whose Streets?" "" "followed in the years after Brown's shooting." ""</seg>

<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrero's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrero's life, how they fall in love and marry their wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin embossed the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black gay women have to bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, she insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatised type of action," "" "at which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who was stirring up this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the intelligence of Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2082">"" "she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home:" "" "chaos." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the cut-outs from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst has served a 35-year prison sentence after having secretly classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline impacted its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit a little intellectual commentary not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six offences against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit her and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned mice became an unequal briefs, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo's illustrated book "Suppressing Images," which foresaw a future that would transform President Chelmos verdict and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid circuits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in graphite.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what hopefully will bring people with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she emerges with a hands-free spy in hand from the disciplinary box of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene of the event, and detectives investigating the bulls as murder while the police are actively seeking the two suspects said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, she has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail declaration that it was now being lauded and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of Chicago's Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK anti-doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," "" "declared Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the reintroduction of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't include anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly subsidized doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has got a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov showed problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one dared to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping checks in Russia in the course of doping scandals.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAS).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moved "in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2199">That divided the company groups.</seg>
<seg id="2200">It was a mere presumption that no health impairment could be expected, it was said in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="2201">From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been demonstrably tested on fipronged anti-lice incision.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographical groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that they get a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap Surveys and Surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approvals results - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financially technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falle in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "I have recently registered as a client." ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "like GLINT, Convercent companies can send tailor-made" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat-charts of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycotting, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company employs Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair traineeships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen had collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media came to their right" "" "that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzy secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors will achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 inspirations, you need to be ready to have 4.000 votes," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, which has seen companies who have too much to rely on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "if you don't follow employees, ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported via GLINT, so salvation.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2260">A lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice areas on campus.</seg>

<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team they represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "this is for the boys the next three days a real pedalling mill," "" "said Bruin-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became a Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three exercise sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already accomplished schedules of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Moras performed six seasons in Westwood's practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are expected to hold 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a sip hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the site and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape tutors, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and started to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access to 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps depicting what was possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled" Knipex Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the puller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are funny about them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" who would make a stepford woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as relapsing.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation, or she can" "" "be in the mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, troubled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not last sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is seeping out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the out-out eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their creators want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump large power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have split up families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all are ostensily criticizing all of us in order to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice has been the power of putting families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs of one day will no longer be repulsed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even terrifying long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the Right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump actually seem to be a very mild criminal.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not part of a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40-s and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have scored the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor lady in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moves from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was hospitalized for the treatment of incisions at his wrists, according to a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death belt because of murder after an appeal of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Law Body said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet more tolerant to tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, who had been separated but had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells were found, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were caught in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells developed.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, researchers L. wasteri increased in a liquid and then passed small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells sank by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerable cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potential high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Navy One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American design programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for running the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2849">A union would like to verify the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow with managers from the biscuit manufacturer McVitie.</seg>

<seg id="2855">GMB Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerned by our members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">Generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't leave Neymar in pursuit of a £189 million offer to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Poggio back in last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisner, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication in relation to the German press agency, he anticipated the former Regensburger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerienced Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that in reporting on violence, two measures were measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is a matter of "shameful and shameful acts," which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we love to go to the church and that's a devoured food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "putts have been a very normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to be done with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the abuses, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the reminder tape" "" "Mein Brother der Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report published by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen. "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domain sparrows were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to many other defendants, many victims underestimated the overall humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories of him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen gives George Ratzinger his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence against violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen," "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which became tangible when a domed set did not perform a top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you consider this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, learn about it too late or have taken first hints not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived as" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also provide an excellent testimony, described him as "warm," "sincere," "sincere," "competent," and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he not only knocked with chairs and threw the keyhole on the floor, but also pulled ear-files and pulled too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such cultivation methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is all about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "there are no translations available." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media, there was a great deal about abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an affected representative for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who, in a way, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable pupil worded it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... books are more urgent or clearer or more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report comes to the clear conclusion:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of all co-ordination.</seg>
<seg id="2943">That way he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "had to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "seeing" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">"" "" "" "must he live with this accusation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Cathedral cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers have been brutally harassed and painted, all of them in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasise, the topic of" "" "preschool" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradise" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims admired the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently give ear to the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when audits had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they happened to be in a legal grey area, as everyone of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">For him it was difficult to estimate, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the death penalty was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism," "" "the danger of assessing the past after today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorred at all times and also not for what has been breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I'm glad that it is finally being worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly against it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his time of Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger quoted in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also speak to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not even admit that there was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding an unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an Institution of Welfare, true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candies, the rebellious boys do not have a great singer and every success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience as Georg Ratzinger experienced during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamentally good, deeply believing and heartfelt people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen date, 23 years after his Emeritierung, to visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
