28 @-@ year @-@ old cook in San Francisco mall found dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse that was found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to combine his style with his family was to always cook something , prepare us dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SF@@ PD by calling the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in a drawer
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside labels , which with me and reality mostly have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress prefers to spend their time at home , in front of TV with loose di@@ ble and Mexican food , is in the magazine .
for the white bubble they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , the horses reminded themselves of their holidays , they gal@@ lo@@ ped home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lop .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he left with his family on the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the gold sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
awards lack the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ owed him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the rower Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ Supplier , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the price of the Lav@@ azza was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a basic , rather philosophical dis@@ regard .
that , about the role of the state .
in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to be rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be massi@@ vely re@@ trac@@ ting regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , states that the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost silent .
the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ut@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp , there could be no party @-@ internal discussions .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and to speed up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , both don &apos;t want to sign .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics claim that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least the rich , will pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has fled has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost to their everyday lives .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a social aid agency in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centralised housing for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ carriers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have gained experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end , as soon as they acc@@ use in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , appreciate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not know to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ dged women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or separate houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are housed together , it can continue - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read on the crush shown on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new combat actions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the Assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had ab@@ used ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students agreed on the refusal of a contract agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have persi@@ sted calm@@ ly , which led to the treaty being rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC bure@@ au agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC bure@@ au has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council today to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour campaigns beginning in September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance specialists in this year struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , Head of the BM@@ A , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he informed BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students that the contract was to be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot for@@ bid that Ankara is most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ row@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something terrible happened .
his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustained cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sky@@ rock@@ eting .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a presum@@ ed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily required by all the friends he can get after he was removed from his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
travel operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated in Russia if flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti stated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st once described me to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now joined .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both pres@@ idents were saying at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even understand the issue .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralised headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private client business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor &apos;s brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch those brands again , so I think the time has come .

Jo@@ ckey Fran@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he made a milestone at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local racing track with his second prize of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ go@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner , D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it has been done by New@@ market because I &apos;ve landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle races - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a has inspired fans for this sport for many years .
I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month ban , but he showed an impressive characteristic force to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 10 years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief of the Log Chief and Chief Executive Officer of the governing staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding legislative rules and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and he recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov spent a long time in one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ te Vladimir Put@@ ins and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , aired on television , both men affir@@ med that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here lies the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complex item - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust me for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V started the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , since a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another nearby Al@@ lies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit manufacturers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed before announ@@ cing his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .

a resident of Ban@@ ff requested help in the identification of the fish , who emerged in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that were pe@@ pper@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have joined the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate , because the toler@@ ances on which the team was working were tiny - they only had a few milli@@ metres on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station started on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat moving around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bo@@ ar without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , this dis@@ b@@ anded when the boat cap@@ sized off the person steering the boat .
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ s his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police told me yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead , the alcohol @-@ star@@ red off@@ ender broke the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her two times .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
Originaltitel : desperate Hou@@ se@@ wives ( TV )
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women re@@ entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old moved his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens are saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are to be put into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manoeu@@ vre concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
first of all , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also come into existence .
the main issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible to investors .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , so viol@@ a , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one reconci@@ le the loss of further 1,@@ 300 attractive apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , the planning politi@@ cian Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into price binding .
this is possible in the West @-@ city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the West @-@ city dates back to the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only that is what the owners , the housing companies do not want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West @-@ city is dr@@ astically increased , one steps from the aim of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social poor in just a few parts of the city will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that it is impossible to find a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness
it is fascinating to watch the world changing .
teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside , but rather prefer spending their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and as soon as they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person res@@ umes every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of market launch , the number of follow @-@ up people running 30 minutes each day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; ble@@ w on deaf ears because many public messages are boring health and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ es@@ ky gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breath taking on the ground .
all along the line brilliant .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast became a multi @-@ battle title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the floating beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign in the women &apos;s gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual Americ@@ anist who wins a multi @-@ battle title and , in total , the fifth , while prof@@ essing their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport of the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ ed from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awaited her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in single multi @-@ campaign women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insisted on never having planned the future during their long way to the top , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - that includes her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 she has not lost a competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture blur@@ red .
Swe@@ be@@ ers and Bo@@ at ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - were l@@ ur@@ king .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on top of the li@@ mb@@ al bar - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor she sat on top of it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her ende@@ aring - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into fine bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she described in her collecting book , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her ground exercises , she cast a com@@ eback to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the start of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most le@@ thal attacks from Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder seems not to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ f@@ ect since the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic housing areas within four months and two others were wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I don &apos;t create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year nor can he still speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I wondered constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floods gives reason to rescue Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ding their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , said that requests for flood vans , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested 10,000 sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ light system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service said that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could drop to rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the River Ri@@ vers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still be@@ headed people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that he had warned him another step @-@ in @-@ law , who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities should be considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been completely absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities gave assur@@ ances that heavy rain and floo@@ ding floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and education failure in five districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals r@@ ins@@ ed from the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house evacu@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but not reported until now on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , shop manager at Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bullet holes , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police told me that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several bru@@ ises , including in the waist , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was punc@@ tured by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with the fact that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot at the station , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just identified if there could be one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge sleeve for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ ded the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a constant struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , there were recept@@ ac@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there are several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the Philadelphia police station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video according to reports .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ pple at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant .
and second , this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ds , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ din , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Katho@@ lik@@ in , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally ech@@ o@@ ing the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an African @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual Americ@@ anist who won Gold at an individual multi @-@ competition event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ n@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ ner is an expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents , who pay for the training , training , travel , competitive and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these Turn@@ clubs lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and that is a long and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bal@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and accessible exercise training .
I founded my gym of 20 years ago .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; thanks to the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend contribut@@ ors to improve the care of the movements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and it will be used to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ving disputes through talks have met with the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the one promised by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the necessity and address the concerns of the assistant physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors in the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reform@@ ulated contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 students who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS collabor@@ ators , called on the affiliated doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour action measures do not only achieve little , but have already stressed over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the Committee of Regi@@ stra@@ sts and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to adhere to agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ co@@ agulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or heart attack .
N@@ HS regulations for regulation N@@ ICE recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ HS regulations for regulation N@@ ICE recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , a blood c@@ lot can cause blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot det@@ aches , it can flow through the blood stream and con@@ gest@@ ed the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes election fraud flour@@ ishing in Muslim neighbor@@ hoods
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to wi@@ ly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , as a cr@@ ushing government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Sal@@ les , former cabinet member , attacks the police , election observers , and town halls to ignore the evidence of elec@@ tive abuse on the grounds of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of elec@@ tors out of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside electoral cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections .
currently , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they give up their voting consent to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should preserve more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic exc@@ esses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person sel@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including guiding outs to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such a behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activist editing documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ aps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed down her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic postal code .
prohibition that political activists edit complete letter @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of letter @-@ elections .
the police have the authority to establish lock@@ outs to set up elec@@ tive stations .
a change of the law , facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 &apos;s Legisl@@ ative Law ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff generally wins that voters go into the elec@@ torate alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no complaint was filed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was ple@@ aded guilty for a number of reasons - in line with the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been out of hand for the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner by the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger , at least not if one is allowed to believe in the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cking on our screens , F@@ email created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks mysteri@@ ously similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;m doing it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ pers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ go@@ er for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ t@@ ress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter us@@ er@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ alds Analysis on the fourth place of the 14 year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron emp@@ tied viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ om@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; went down like low &quot; and died during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when he had to abandon his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m indoor relay squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited he went down like an ief , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers around Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died like a pig ? ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not capit@@ ulated that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , many of whom were talking about him
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ bly By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter us@@ er@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you just represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes all of us look like ra@@ cists .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been aired about a swimming power . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC continued to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the information on Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators on show and our follow @-@ up in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the woman swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who have sham@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman dra@@ gged her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed , as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she tried again and left business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the shop floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own sto@@ cking pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved away and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone looking at someone - or thinking about the person who could buy the under@@ pants she tried under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you think anyone would take home cap@@ tives that had a different person and who weren &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a narr@@ ator from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were taken out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you come back from behind you should turn around as first so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the att@@ acker cur@@ ls against pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they focus the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is most secure to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ ens for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and saus@@ ages from a serious examination by le@@ ver@@ aging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
prior to the landing of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought to lick the pur@@ ge of a pulling toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public hand@@ rails to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task of the immune system is definitely under a test
in the film he said , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test @-@ line showed a lumin@@ ous figure of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ osity rate of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick , after their lumin@@ osity ran@@ ged more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 .
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This comes to the worst that I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming sessions that ended we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular , associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irre@@ parable state .
the walls turned pla@@ in@@ ly holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive cries , fights and floods included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were used in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing hosted her and her partner forci@@ bly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by the facilit@@ ated neighbors who said their lives were made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are telling the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have ab@@ used the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the church , garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion is always the last step towards considering Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household administration workers will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains surrounding the house &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , parap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found herself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee skel@@ eton , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti @-@ coated .
the police said they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who were har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists to panic in Portugal after an eff@@ ec@@ tional military jet flying over beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal survived the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an unbelievable storm
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was present
this was the moment in which scared tourists start to panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent jet drops over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun @-@ worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle systems without seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew over twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew lower than usual due to poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which limits his sight .
the plane was on a training flight , in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with cares about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first stage win in the new season of football on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash is climbing three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w@@ ter has to rel@@ inqu@@ ish to N@@ ey@@ mar with the inferior Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe League champion while competing with Brazil as the Olympic Football tournament .
also missing is Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in lig@@ ament in the knee , with which the inser@@ tion question at Bar@@ ca was at least clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
in this regard , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applicants holds the lead .
before the first compulsory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness status of the crew , which was humili@@ ated at a test match of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. had not really convinced .
Sevilla in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with up to now , Barcelona has achieved eleven successes as the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a dedicated league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic Champion .
on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the World Ranking Ring took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes in World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made the title each other out .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese title would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five W@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had pulled back onto the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their guns on their own in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches up to here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected stirring match evolved .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the bronze play against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in the quarter @-@ finals of the German Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Russians pulled out a rib@@ bed injury , and after that was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similarly high table @-@ tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp recognizes &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to iron out their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now under@@ took short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the general Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary usually vo@@ iced concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 rivals within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp from evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sch@@ ism .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds of war
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ron in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equal to the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview from the CN@@ BC station , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that right , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened to strike money to support his election campaign , he should not present a better survey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of seeking the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress more powerful among the arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia : Tri@@ ster Sc@@ am bei D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a fraud test during a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to promptly establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official had announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has sought the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own research , an IA@@ AF spokesman shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and treated himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the trial , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is supposed to have informed athletes from his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
after numerous dop@@ ing failures , Kenya has been under special scrut@@ iny at the IO@@ C for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls launched by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , an unusual warning was made that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya removed from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und , last but not least , called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had hired in the Russian athle@@ tics field .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ art became widespread and systematic .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very l@@ atin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musically unusual !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
she is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of its movements , in its looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family had learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that they were killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News posted Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from east London climbed into a plane to Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton would remain the Supreme Court in the case of a victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presi@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell holds that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge in the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate the land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons Team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ can block@@ aded the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ per workers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ fit for the Pres@@ i@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to be nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ aner to release a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distinguishes from Old@@ school Play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to go back to the presentation of timeless and classic naked , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts on mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with ten thousands of fighters who flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Chairman of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand fighters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already sur@@ passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with pen@@ alties already few months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey are on the run .
after the vain coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ e cities .
in this way Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Le@@ aders demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and secular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already declared the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all accepted as eligible ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey is not aimed at comb@@ ating war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum seekers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up counting voices , only work pain@@ fully .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again make election campaign short of the people passing by .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how severely newcom@@ er Af@@ D performs and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ du@@ sting .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , spread li@@ lies and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ey has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its prime candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if one makes the right place at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Co@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not abandon the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ co@@ ded , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also realised that in the country you make the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ o to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for its SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD still clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
from the holiday @-@ necessity they make a modern virtue and embarrass@@ ed their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the chairman of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green poll@@ sters go on a search for local vocal ch@@ ats among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , turns straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refurbishment : gas chambers suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only end at around 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise .
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the start of the week to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the same applies to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up parking places .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the town has been relaxed .
the citizens can now return from Of@@ ter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment department .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ free@@ way , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality increasingly challenged the car from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been over@@ heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km kilometers in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is just a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 re@@ development has resulted in revenue losses in them leaves everyone one asks to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for them the renovation hardly has consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running message is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crowns , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only it , but all restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue amounts to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his main kli@@ ent@@ el comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thi@@ cker security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they urge none .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was concerned with results and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , filed : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knock jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also requires nothing , which doesn &apos;t have any chances at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they have in part in themselves : he plans quick trials for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
in the event of ret@@ ali@@ ation for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to face some worse than previously - for example , those who commit crimes or intentionally throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
some also seems un@@ extinct and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in case of un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg have been refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people were not cl@@ inging out even in election times .
the inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , it is an election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in place on the subject of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it was high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ gan@@ t dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security @-@ political idea collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for re@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a turn away from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fixed the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in case of a bur@@ q@@ a ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , must first show up .
there &apos;s a lot of things in it , which could cause controversy .
but even the SPD is currently attempting to gain advantage in the subject of inner security .
President Sig@@ mar Gabriel kindly sign@@ alled cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
nor does Volkswagen get off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers worldwide are rising .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall campaign there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen starts sales in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest auto manufacturer continues to show a plus in spite of the diesel .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand became weaker , especially in Western Europe , and thus again loaded the total sales , as announced by Da@@ x .
worldwide , the VW brand in July sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below last year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s sales team led the weaker figures from July , primarily at two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a purchase restra@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for leaving the EU was also bur@@ dened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the United States , where the ab@@ at@@ ement first escal@@ ated , a minus can also be found .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected family brand of Nieder@@ sachsen has already got off lightly thanks to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is attributable to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
sales of Group sales Fred Kap@@ pler continued to gain sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas with a software .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car@@ ver places the customer a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the editions of my Commission of In@@ quiry and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that , in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deterior@@ ations occur after retro@@ fitting and all type @-@ approved vehicle values have persi@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was meant in corporate journeys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come in a workshop half a year after the conversion , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the off@@ shoot sc@@ andal has caused uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW do not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in the future penalty interest rates - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not have to worry about paying for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
since September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund asks private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said .
he has been keeping 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now spends the cost on the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ sustainable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay across deposits for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more abund@@ antly equipped by the wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it hats free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;

Dest@@ ination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before submitting to the comment section , to s@@ nat@@ ch it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ aven@@ ue of middle @-@ aged men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects but to mi@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyers group .
there is also no hor@@ des caused by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older records retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
if this blog is a news report on television , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o run a modest grey suit and stu@@ ffy before I stand , hold my hands and say something to me like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , dem I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record audi@@ torium of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a store like Phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took off@@ ence to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects to watch happy singing memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a sort of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so by many people .
it is an easy way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came in just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less music @-@ class .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in .
pit stop , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ more packed pop instead of experimental jazz bo@@ oming from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been working in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards available for sale .
it rather makes a shopping bag than a shopping basket .
it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to brave the jeans hotel pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
although my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they steer clear of the star@@ ing gaze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of any middle @-@ aged men .

French court bor@@ rows offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also ensured that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ f@@ ecture are &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ drop was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of survivors rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin continues to fight
despite his dis@@ appointing appearance at the Olympic time , cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time @-@ driving World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the last few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ looking En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed pol@@ ishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adher@@ ed to .
but a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted by a modem .
laser measurement technology can also capture all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans according to time , distance and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ ri@@ dden state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also slip @-@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ ur with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain catches up silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s master@@ class gold catches up
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fiji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back@@ backs , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed due to the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals the same day could fall on them in the final .
but independently of that Fiji had beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Bri@@ t tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck will be : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she was lost under Ryan each game with Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji had a wonderful start and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce away from fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. in as if one would run into driving coaches . the World Series winner took 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au shi@@ ed in the corner .
Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner with four minutes of playing time .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a prec@@ ur@@ sor T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Berg from guy Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute , lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK Team and ran to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play 7 , while UK still learn to learn .
this is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the Fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South @-@ se@@ ein@@ ate , whose fans sang flags and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ams put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ti@@ pped cr@@ ushing into the lawn .
in the past , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when she scre@@ ened for the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unused operation , which is also unparalleled .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on with willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more suppor@@ ter than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky enough to start at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a mor@@ ein@@ ous morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked with Hel@@ en and Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t look forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the Wasser@@ verband &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this meant that it was a while ago in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia s@@ wore the purpose @-@ association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was employed for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband , was 28 years old as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , sponsors about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget@@ ing , fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there have been no dead@@ lock and I have always added innovations because water is the main source of food and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation , Gö@@ ll@@ ers praised the faithful , reliable and correct ministry for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for reducing nit@@ rate at the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the rup@@ ture of the hop@@ per at the church lou@@ der on January 3 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now study private in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he recalls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partner of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , he will be publicly punished .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters big , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the di@@ ligence or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she affir@@ med that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - bright prospects for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs .
financial burdens arising from the renewable energy sector are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion at the existing facilities for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Commerce Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on the production of its own electricity .
so the status quo of the current regulation is largely written .
Gabriel for the steel industry is particularly important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be considered in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw masses of steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation got somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite increasing prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious .
they produced with 3.4 million tonnes a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German economic association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced crowd went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects a rising output in the coming months .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt he studied music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
S@@ ingen is a great hobby for the elderly from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in the old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak out and organize , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breath .
those who regularly demand his lungs don &apos;t get out of the box in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations the singing has a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
lyrics and especially melodies often ent@@ ail people suffering from dementia due to long @-@ term events .
in singing , a special performance is required , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who will hear when a tone goes next ?
if you are looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ ate choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internet search .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cr@@ aters to the cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the ru@@ ff@@ ing of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ chew@@ ing also did not let the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression @-@ degree of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
sk@@ aters react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not important for the males , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries out with the ur@@ gency of their dependency .
nine adult males and eight female companions were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of babies who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not yet offspring , re@@ acted to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rot@@ ated faster to the speaker when the calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens were playing .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist reported to Marina Sche@@ du@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former foot@@ ball@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was suspended after the fall in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , responsible for the coup attempt .
this will not stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the state of exception , imposed for 90 days , is still valid until October , in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night@@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public squares throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what the Turks united in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al Win@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will be very happy again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were eliminated early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the southern part of Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez who , with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ schutz , laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez treaty , which had been bor@@ rowed at AC Florence , had only been announced after the attempted put@@ sch , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , however , the storm would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his € 7.5 million , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have won med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ ova , who had been compla@@ ining after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock shortly before the games , was picked up mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it offered a bizarre scenery : with a raised smile she was still stum@@ bling in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when he found out that she was not going to pick up gold , the audience left in a rush of jam .
but there are many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the Rio Olympics in the Olympic Games .
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and former World Champion goes even faster than before , he is number one in the world in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the 2012 Olympic Champion , world championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic was arrested and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and had been locked 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , entered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete had been identified as many med@@ als later .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ ad@@ di of the 2008 Olympic Games also returned to the International Sports Tribunal of the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record heal@@ er and gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world world champion references to taking a prohibited food supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA dropped mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th .
bom@@ b@@ astic terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
I suffered from wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I had already left it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also affected , for the time being still unclear .
in this respect , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up and another person was killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself to possible motives , but it is likely that it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency and international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Bangkok spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police told their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they mostly do not judge themselves against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that has been used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bombar@@ d@@ ment of the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding the instructions of Thai safety authorities to follow .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution which was dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which after a phase of bloody un@@ rest after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members itself to have restored the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the ri@@ fl@@ ing rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t plot of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also made the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence for efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are in an extrem@@ ist way diff@@ use .
that is why we are watching the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are already observing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely aligned with the state offices when deciding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical exercise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts are generally trying to address them with a youth @-@ like language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the entities are Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there had been reports of contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that he had no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - is changing its direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changing direction and becoming extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the marked increase in lawful crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be justi@@ fiable structural structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerns expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who were not appearing in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently turned into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his CV with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
because most sports@@ men run in a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first beat about 100 metres of free style with a minute and almost five seconds , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run took care of media attention .
the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from equ@@ atorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete in a pre @-@ trial of more than 100 metres of free @-@ style .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it will either work , or I have a very nice long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post wants to offer its electric vans from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gf@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ appointing business figures
the Consumer Research Group Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ ings came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K warned that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uns@@ afe , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the global number five in the industry faces a personnel start @-@ up .
Gf@@ K CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
on 1 September , the management board of the board of directors , Gerhard Haus@@ print@@ inger , took over the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy as a reason for the return . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a spokesman on Friday .
anyone who will be responsible for the market research company will be still unclear at this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ung circles it was on Friday , at the shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring programme initiated years ago had grown large . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor will at some point become uns@@ ett@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .

in relation to the first half of the year , sales tot@@ aled EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million by 3.4 percent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the s@@ unken value of the company .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cur@@ bs : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the prisoners suffered severe injuries , the police par@@ ted .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to switch to a counter that drove partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fire Department liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to an accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were taken from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 Euro as of October 1 , 2016 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ level calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf then amounts to 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget was determined by the District Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ cover for these sewage installations .
due to legal foundations , Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from world companies , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the Board , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or cover@@ ages from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated .
Schmidt explained the severe fee increases with all three waste water systems for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the sewage works in all three facilities are slightly declining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ eding calculation period in all three facilities , refurbishment and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three facilities .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for the world &apos;s stake , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as the Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pumping station , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into consideration in the new calculation period , came to these extraordinary expenses . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ häuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incident in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has spar@@ ed the waste water systems over the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage treatment association in order to not extend these facilities because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , compared to a positive 0,2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; Restaurants and hotels ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices stayed as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as an asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ bl@@ unt , self @-@ cent@@ red tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all abor@@ tions are brought to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when a filter proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow haw@@ k . &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced r@@ att@@ oos reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose tweet on the photos has been widely distributed , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and mild . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the descending extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pit@@ cher .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an article on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that ra@@ mming @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its own private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently hired a staff responsible focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said on the other hand that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership false ISIS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the real conditions on the ground , announced an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mit@@ ees and the Armed Forces Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically picked up by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened with Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct reference to government tips given under Obama &apos;s instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from mid @-@ year 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command points out the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ com reports is underway by the Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the intelligence community released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the Adam B. Schiff representative house , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon inspec@@ tor , who had been picked up after complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the Inspec@@ tor General &apos;s investigations are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have differing opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls alleg@@ ations of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker pointed out that contrary to the statements made by the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of the women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after having fired three goals over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever to have done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , they know that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last play of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each .
the first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , leading the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ ut the ro@@ ar completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was in the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ guard to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsor and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in Olympic round gymnas@@ tics .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally accepted : air pi@@ ps , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely aware that many who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic sports .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there was never a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain external charm , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ enlightened person for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ onist cit@@ tern of its never @-@ ending interval - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring Win@@ ner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and s@@ cars ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympi@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are rated according to performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in the TV broadcast : the world or the Olympic Centre .
the target @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a little ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the pole v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then downward , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and finals of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ na@@ sts have recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia were pushing for violent resistance by the government .
witnesses testified that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with police at gun@@ shot .
is Ethiop@@ ian just about to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos being circul@@ ating about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights authority now calls for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa , and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks in the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded rapidly .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constra@@ ined , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or imprisonment , killed or driven into the depths of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options out of protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ew@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the governing coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were forced more or less defeated in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hiding under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave an indication that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high @-@ nation@@ als from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was specially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special agents to manipul@@ ate opponents and render them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ar@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
different from Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ ind@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested against elections which , according to analysts , apparently were mis@@ guided by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mal@@ function of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ic city , carried out by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his statement Obama had founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ing that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , to the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp beha@@ ved in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ations were completely serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling exchange values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this topic .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to v@@ age his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp accepted an even more cher@@ ished note , as his survey values have declined further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention over the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has put his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind band@@ ages , completely false , and so it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed ISIS to spread by allowing them to take control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of having to face each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed out of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ invention .
a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural ac@@ ac@@ ces .
the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by Willi@@ am@@ sburg Pri@@ ces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the club had closed , she gave up coffee drinks for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still has his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he didn &apos;t hear a gru@@ dge about sei@@ zing the old business space .
in fact , the owners of soap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ asted coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has planned to put them out soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a pl@@ um pu@@ dding as dessert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
CO@@ s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Bri@@ ck@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; An ongoing meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , snork@@ eling snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture did eat .
when the re@@ porter stopped h@@ opping , this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man .
there were tons of pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were made from an ingredient and something cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rock@@ ers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces the paths with which the country went around to be no longer the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e understood why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes like bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ due , &quot; the bri@@ ck@@ man noticed that chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the central point of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar blends have been tried as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over flavor or even healthy food .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the recipes of the house .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to con@@ serve an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House brought out the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country was back on its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did indeed make people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosevelt had lunch at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name , humble recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the ground to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their lives at risk in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him during an 11 hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had talked in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland H@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland H@@ arks only get their offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average just 1,@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist predicted long that Greenland hair will be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland H@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sv@@ alb@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers are aware of the lifestyle of Greenland hair .
their slow motion was measured by six animals with a transmitter in front of Sv@@ alb@@ ard .
nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another one swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Sv@@ alb@@ ard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth was to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus with@@ holds a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
in their l@@ enti@@ cular core , all larger Greenland @-@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to associate the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ irs with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on grass @-@ flame .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal stir@@ s warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life .
building site in double pack
the municipal council has dealt with issues relating to construction in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , plot and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying could be asked , the sale of the plots in the residential area &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building permits can now register in the town hall from now on , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els in its September session .
in order to be able to meet requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , coupled with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area that has already been designated there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks continue to operate from London on financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is now sufficient for them to be admitted to the UK .
this is just how big US banks use .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , and other important authorities such as the European insurance Supervisory Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin , it is worse in the infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city features readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , and less crime .
in a ranking of the business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is located in seventh place , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , econom@@ ists say .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead to receive legal expenses from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has claimed the refund of the legal costs that you have created from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents filed by Mer@@ ck , after a US judge covered a pattern of wrong@@ doing by Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , US president , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the case of the F@@ ist defence .
Mer@@ ck tries to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck appe@@ aled to each other and took advantage of laboratory work to use sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , active ingredient in the Gilead medication .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have taken full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in town have left it , said a group spokesman on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb the city after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they liberated over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council on Reuters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying on clean@@ up jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
on Friday , H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 , resulting in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; the former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s electoral hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democratic candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the control inspections are not complete .
Tru@@ mp critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for charitable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp request his tax return to be published .
on Thursday she addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little tax for two years , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released fiscal statement back to 2007 .
the Clinton who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans .
its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea many years ago , intensified their promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvesting without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the tel@@ eph@@ on dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ree mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the spark only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air .
a hint of quite usually already enough to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer that shoots a gold torch in the air and causes a loud , light explosion .
Stad@@ tre@@ aten decides unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ os@@ k@@ re@@ building on St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects are taking place by business owners with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail trade in the core city is now considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
however , the city council rejected the request for the construction of a sales ski co@@ ke on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhin@@ e@@ Baltic con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine River , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media uprising after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arab guests were &quot; challenged &quot; according to an employee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Brist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swal@@ lowed it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a very big response from the internet in which people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of them gave the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged re@@ forest@@ ation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in another post that pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added that the country code has been added .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to explain what led the police to install rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the governor of the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying on walls against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the latest protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate for its withdrawal .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teheran was by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest on Russian @-@ based businesses grew strongly in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign agency admitted some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries for the number of tourist destinations in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
wanted to witness : beverage market falling into forest fires
on Thursday evening a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL has been practi@@ sed at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the guard of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had per@@ ished their faces , were forced to withdraw cash from the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 m tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly accessible .
after the assault , the perpetrators must travel towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fle@@ dged from the gravel parking place located opposite the car park with the silver coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who made observations about the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) reported in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y fall should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer season .
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gic day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet area of the leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ven during the first week of the school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ retten with the visit to the string zoo .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and p@@ addle .
the culinary delights of children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared meals , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of hom@@ ec@@ oming , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed at home .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar @-@ stran@@ ts from the sea sor@@ bent unit of Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were carried out .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ s@@ ander journey of all the stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bischof@@ sburg city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and H@@ ath@@ ias , went their way .
in the evening before the pastor sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and distributed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , each accompanied by a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely made a rest in order to sing together a song from a dedicated pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights the par@@ son@@ age houses of the local parish were available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of the stages for a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags on this stage , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to drop some 500 metres in the heat of the heat and climbed again afterwards .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it was on the final stage to Freiburg .
deliberately facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
thanks to a small impulse , God was given thanks .
Min@@ is by the operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite won Gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the velo@@ drome of Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the yen made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the run@@ ways in London in March despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner win an Olympic course in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and retired Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the final round , we set up an Olympic race and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 Triumph at Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des said he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to British rivals .
this time there was no such problem with such a superb victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the UK flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) mean a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only contest of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ way four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won Gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie archi@@ v@@ est of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK Team is relying on his strong track team to dominate the middle age of the Olympic Games and to bring a medal to med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April was in the midst of sex and mo@@ bbing repro@@ aches as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting plant of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting plant in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus all supply contracts will be lifted , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years is proceeding in November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2000 jobs in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the point of Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , said that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting plant , &quot; the company announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to income in fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual report amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in anticip@@ ation of cancellation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if it is yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn against possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land spends some 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , crip@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ended with a classical turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every episode episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in that publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertisement from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ part ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still se@@ eping through the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat @-@ Video ( even though it all applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always a little stra@@ ined .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them as &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling up again when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
but to lay around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is watching Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers exhibit 160@@ ,000 people a year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid services are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry is concerned with the effects of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who do not have any means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell &apos;s Community Centers states that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers has shown that thousands of people are dismissed every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without a suspension of the Federal Government &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction Campaign accused of having report@@ edly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that in February her campaign leader for North Carolina aimed a fire@@ arm on a staff while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a bill of indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i announced to have been waiting for months to regulate the matter internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a pi@@ sto@@ l , put his right finger on the trigger , and cur@@ led the run into Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he stated in his indictment .
after having appe@@ aled to the local and regional campaign management , he found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was indic@@ ted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to do damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment came only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons friends - should take action if its rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign clearly indicated that the media would have pulled out his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tru@@ mp &apos;s press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip did likewise fail .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
on calls to his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before federal elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U governments are drawing up .
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could barely go@@ vern , this is not possible after the fra@@ ctions in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( 8.@@ 7 percent previously ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent of the country &apos;s parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happened exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Büro für West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax it was possible to reach communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit slowly slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could imagine in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of a smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; cell phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today is dominated by providers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
always online , this is a daily routine for many people today .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the key breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple &apos;s CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ ant move began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
the sa@@ ws are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his cell 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said just Jan@@ ina Kugel , in charge of staff in the Siemens Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction in He@@ a@@ throw , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new jobs , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding lifts is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ assing on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in social growth and leave a legacy of skill and employment in both the airport and the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block@@ age are equal to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ings on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block ads on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding for its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect indicating which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams said that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ f@@ ro @-@ struggle between the an@@ zei@@ wor@@ ding open source community and the um@@ ers has already been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying ads have become a wor@@ rying indicator for the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , approximately 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
the company , apart from mobile ad block@@ ers , has no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m sharing a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a big share of revenues , so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be a concern for new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we instead focused on Develop@@ ers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman in case of presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was convic@@ ted by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss resident at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who call on them as well as every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes distributed Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor needs to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after she had passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took judgment .
the court found out that the polic@@ ew@@ oman - who had replied to an emergency -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable once again according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could once have er@@ ased similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow moving of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to harbour life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turning of Venus is exposed to the sun &apos;s day@@ time side for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planets scientists .
although it was probably inhabited , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans have evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or has been burned out by ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers analysed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as a trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co@@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed out in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal &apos;s Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the armed parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold a few full day sessions over the next few weeks that will start next year to tackle the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rate of credit is followed by a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released tens of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes held in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler mis@@ ses the rotation rate of stars in the galax@@ y of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades star enh@@ ouses .
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rotation @-@ periods are related to planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ es , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning to the quick@@ est now .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars po@@ ke large quantities of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler accepts the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas larger stars rotate slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still far ahead of us what we would like to learn more , such as how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional response announcement , the 41 year old professional will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August at the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen as the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature in a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to create some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important stat@@ s .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is nevertheless not supposed to be included in the fame Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had forbidden stero@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ e@@ the@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not running silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends are still playing the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az with act@@ ress and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e &apos;s rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
the athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have been announced for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the athle@@ tics competitions already critically acclaimed .
at Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands a full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Court of Justice CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of the athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample fell by thanks to Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , there should be no EP@@ O for blood dop@@ ing .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have had a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the public with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , about all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Federation banned the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , including the nation @-@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming @-@ sport , the previous off@@ sets in China were also taken care of between the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m free , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively by the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but had to wait only a three @-@ month lock .
data theft : as per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies reported in the past twelve months at least once , partially victims of an attack using black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations made by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling quick evolution of the malicious software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered the black@@ mail software .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
the software then presents the demands of black@@ mail presses .
to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware arrives .
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies paying , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , establish freely accessible support websites or unlock for free example files .
and if private persons are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ heads .
the malware kits have created so far by which malware itself , advice and additional tools have been purchased for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will be made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ b survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement alone , the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
the perpetrators could also take up entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Def@@ con chi@@ pper conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could control an internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and rear , it does not work in any position .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top drops down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with folded back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a feature chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .

the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is yet another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for security systems , the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tempo controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI connector are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards .

airline does not accept : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability can only be possible in case of haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their trip , sick people only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent most of the vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no contamination has been found in the samples of the water .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people worried about further attacks .
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to terrorist attacks .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and spl@@ itting .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if the perpetr@@ ator had to leave the country more quickly , this would increase security and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit size order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , which will be amended to make weapons in the internet more difficult .
the last much discussed Swiss duty of sec@@ rec@@ y is supposed to remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with physicians , he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the threat of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a look at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ q@@ a prohibition and the abolition of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you bor@@ row , and I lean on the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to simul@@ ate action and action with an ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people no longer safe in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the Motor@@ way br@@ inger
it is st@@ owed regularly on the stra@@ ddle road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic jams when they travel via the motorway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ run road construction will extend on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ el Straße to the right @-@ wing track by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from Hammer Street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , whereby the overall sequence is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is driving the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log reaches the bridge across the Alber@@ ian Way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is that the needle fle@@ ece on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ el Straße .
from here , traffic is only chann@@ elled in one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load force , in order to include in particular heavy duty traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ in @-@ day traffic will last can not be said by the competent regional company .
however , years to come : the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction ceremony , the state farm deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it was to be expected .
the traffic will be guided by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students aged eleven to 15 visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most youth of the class had come from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music between the ages of 14 and 20 .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical communication are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
ra@@ ins instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ bu@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a line through the bill in the night - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we can see many shooting stars in the sky .
the Star schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent find their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , a member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an I / O disorder .
it is precisely the diar@@ rho@@ ea that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind them can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not in@@ frequently , the sleep problem is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc may lie bad , wake up every two to three hours and may start to s@@ alu@@ te about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ be a doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised by the day should go to the doctor , advises her .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate the distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - in question .
there is hardly any resident sleeping doctor in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , she advises .
this can be clari@@ fied with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for the investigation in the sleep laboratory , doctors , for example , advise snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in cases of abnormal fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance , says Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disgu@@ ise , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
it counts on : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , stop drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at night at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the Short @-@ way World Championships in Doh@@ a and simultaneously set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates in his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the transport system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and don &apos;t look as closely as they do when it comes to dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for some time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insisted the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice @-@ cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : baggage theft arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civil servants of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage theft as a gang .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants at the Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences .
since the middle of July , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and were committed to a joint , labour @-@ conscious and very professional manner .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ary 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had travelled to Germany specifically for the crimes of crimes committed in Germany .
they had captured a total of more than € 15,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , some lime trees , in between there is still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police numbers them to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ar .
someone &quot; ugly &quot; has jumped to the front of a grey house .
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished as soon as possible , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will , however , be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the tenants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel pronounced itself several times for a hard action by the police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks of official asser@@ tions with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocking parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers commissioned the unknown home@@ owners to renov@@ ate the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about the late i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens lie in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
lef@@ tist force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children , are mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who desper@@ ately wanted to seek police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Strasse , close to the Riga D@@ ome .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a ver@@ itable street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and partly occupied by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pol@@ l planners from around the world : with them now residents from GDR times and former house @-@ owned squ@@ at@@ ters share their Kie@@ z .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them at fixed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ handed violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes constitute property damage , which tend to encounter new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , uncertainty cannot be mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the 94 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are their neighbours , they are certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga @-@ Strasse - and remained .
this is why it was so important to her that the inhabitants got their street back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away : due to the fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - people who are not so good are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what can we do if someone never listen ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and residents .
for newcom@@ ers who are fond of color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub area , compla@@ ining bad about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee agency
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group of refugees , administration , authorities and who else is still involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group suggested that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the un@@ finished Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
this meant that some - less mo@@ cking than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be available at Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibilities change from the Board of Directors to the municipality and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far , unless you rely on private apartments , thus Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be re@@ plen@@ ished , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
besides a permanent home , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but action does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so jump here administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the trial is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually find the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach no one can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems too , says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which may be nai@@ ve to many &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region .
