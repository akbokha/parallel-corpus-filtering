<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="11">He left with his family on the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a basic, rather philosophical disregard.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">In doubt, Trump wants to be rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will be massively retracting regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states that the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost silent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teuty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, there could be no party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to speed up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly expand and demand renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rushed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics claim that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least the rich, will pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot forbid that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something terrible happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustained coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was skyrocketing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a presumed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily required by all the friends he can get after he was removed from his ministry last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated in Russia if flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti stated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst once described me to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now joined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both presidents were saying at the press conference that they didn't even understand the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="3">Jockey Franie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made a milestone at Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden on his local racing track with his second prize of the night.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was a part of Putin's closest confidence circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later became the chief of the Log Chief and Chief Executive Officer of the governing staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding legislative rules and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and he recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov spent a long time in one of the closest confidante Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, aired on television, both men affirmed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here lies the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complex item - you could almost say - to entrust me for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV started the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, since a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another nearby Allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the North deck of Queensland crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, because the tolerances on which the team was working were tiny - they only had a few millimetres on each side.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "manoeuvre concept" "" "at the next meeting of the council." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>

<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also come into existence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann says: "how do we deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">Despite this, so viola, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one reconcile the loss of further 1,300 attractive apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning politician Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch the world changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside, but rather prefer spending their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and as soon as they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person resumes every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, who pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of market launch, the number of follow-up people running 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time," "coming from the sofa" and "being active every day" blew on deaf ears because many public messages are boring health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also gruesky gamblers who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenturnen</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breath taking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">All along the line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast became a multi-battle title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles contests on the floating beam during the solo multi-campaign in the women's gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual Americanist who wins a multi-battle title and, in total, the fifth, while professing their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport of the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou rescued from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in single multi-campaign women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party, Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long way to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - that includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, was trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has not lost a competition for competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture blurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swebeers and Boat urns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on top of the limbal bar - and with a 15,933 on the floor she sat on top of it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her endearing - a pure formality - and tears poured into fine bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she described in her collecting book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercises, she cast a comeback to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning from the start of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympionship in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three Turnerds, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewdin, and Madison Kocian, the Katholikin, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally echoing the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth heterosexual Americanist who won Gold at an individual multi-competition event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see turnaround classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnsts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turner is an expensive sport and turner primarily in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents, who pay for the training, training, travel, competitive and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnclubs lie in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is a long and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities aun countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality Turns that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" thanks to the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anti-coagulation drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, which form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the covering breaks apart, a blood clot can cause blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot detaches, it can flow through the blood stream and congested the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons already having a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have another risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture makes election fraud flourishing in Muslim neighborhoods</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to wily ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, as a crushing government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Salles, former cabinet member, attacks the police, election observers, and town halls to ignore the evidence of elective abuse on the grounds of "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and communal government, which is now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of electors out of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not to apply removable ink on a person's finger when they give up their voting consent to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistle-blowers should preserve more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non-official committees or working groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupted and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical ways," and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic excesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person selects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm about the fraudulent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including guiding outs to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "as evidence has been indicated that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi backgrounds."

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and sausages from a serious examination by leveraging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a purge of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the landing of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting into.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the purge of a pulling toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task of the immune system is definitely under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said, "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test-line showed a luminous figure of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminosity rate of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick, after their luminosity ranged more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This comes to the worst that I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming sessions that ended we said" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular, associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="4">After a fraud test during a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee agreed to promptly establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation has sought the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own research, an IAAF spokesman shared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "stated in an IAAF statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and treated himself as Ferguson Rotich, released and signed the trial," explained Kenya's head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics Leader Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>

<seg id="16">After numerous doping failures, Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, an unusual warning was made that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-doping agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.</seg>
<seg id="20">In consequence, WADA Kenya removed from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>

<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly raised that doping agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound, last but not least, called for a similar investigation into Kenya, as he had hired in the Russian athletics field.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that in this sport-art became widespread and systematic.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting voices, only work painfully.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again make election campaign short of the people passing by.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how severely newcomer AfD performs and what remains at the end of coalition-dusting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread lilies and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy," "" "We create that" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its prime candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if one makes the right place at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel's parliament is in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "this means cocoded, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU electoral fighter Koko to his comrades is also self-exposing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for its SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD still clearly won with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 refurbishment: gas chambers suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30am in the morning and only end at around 20 o'clock, there are always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the start of the week to the south, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The same applies to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up parking places.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has resumed, the traffic situation within the town has been relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasion by the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment department.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachfreeway, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were looking and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly challenged the car from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were significant overrides," "" "says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been overheated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 km kilometers in the speed-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is just a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has resulted in revenue losses in them leaves everyone one asks to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "who has less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "so for other companies, for them the renovation hardly has consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "maximum slight drop" "", "but also admits that of course" "" "the running message is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crowns, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only it, but all restaurants have hit it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the revenue amounts to" "" "far more than 50 percent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road marking has thrown back its operation" "" "by two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "half of his employees have to be dismissed." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his main klientel comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his host has experienced in their long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="22">In the event of retaliation for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to face some worse than previously - for example, those who commit crimes or intentionally throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some also seems unextinct and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in case of unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before submitting to the comment section, to snatch it under the pseudonym non-avenue of middle-aged men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the re-emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the newness of physical objects but to milife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyers group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes caused by hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older records retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on television, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho run a modest grey suit and stuffy before I stand, hold my hands and say something to me like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, dem I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend some time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of trailers of the record auditorium of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers took offence to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects to watch happy singing memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a sort of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so by many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally employ yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flirts from a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came in just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Pit stop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest Synthesizer- and sexmore packed pop instead of experimental jazz booming from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the mental traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been working in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shopping bag than a shopping basket.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to brave the jeans hotel pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of any middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also ensured that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of Calais "prefecture are" absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the teardrop was the Jungle Book Kids "café of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed measurers: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-looking Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary speed polishing, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days, while the case data is transmitted encrypted by a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology can also capture all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans according to time, distance and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-quilting, backbacks, line-up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of that Fiji had beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck will be: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she was lost under Ryan each game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had a wonderful start and allowed the attacks to bounce away from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in as if one would run into driving coaches. the World Series winner took 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau shied in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner with four minutes of playing time.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A precursor Tackle from Mitchell stopped the Berg from guy Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, lete jasa Veremalua went a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK Team and ran to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play 7, while UK still learn to learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South-seeinate, whose fans sang flags and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliams put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB tipped crushing into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky enough to start at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>

<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitensteingruppe was" "" "Bavarian" "" "as exemplary." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was employed for 31 years in the Zweckverband, was 28 years old as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, sponsors about 150,000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budgeting, fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), property purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer controller (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no deadlock and I have always added innovations because water is the main source of food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation, Göllers praised the faithful, reliable and correct ministry for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for reducing nitrate at the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised the water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well construction and restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the renewable energy sector are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition at the existing facilities for the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister of Commerce Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have effect, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the produced crowd went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the prior-year figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt he studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singen is a great hobby for the elderly from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in the old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak out and organize, to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs don't get out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the singing has a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies often entail people suffering from dementia due to long-term events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who will hear when a tone goes next?</seg>
<seg id="29">If you are looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senate choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up and another person was killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During detonation near the beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, which killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself to possible motives, but it is likely that it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency and international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a Bangkok spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have kept secret indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they mostly do not judge themselves against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bombardment of the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommending the instructions of Thai safety authorities to follow.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution which was drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which after a phase of bloody unrest after a period of bloody unrest, remembers itself to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rifling rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest plot of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently turned into a viral internethite.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming-association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most sportsmen run in aedics, Habte wanted to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussebani's run took care of media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The performance of the swimmers from equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete in a pre-trial of more than 100 metres of free-style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussebani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.10 Euro as of October 1, 2016 for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl 3,44 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-level calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf then amounts to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget was determined by the District Council of Kulmbach that undercover for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, Kasendorf is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from world companies, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented the Board, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or coverages from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the severe fee increases with all three waste water systems for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs could have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the sewage works in all three facilities are slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the receding calculation period in all three facilities, refurbishment and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three facilities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for the world's stake, Neudorf and Reuth as well as the Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled by reason and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into consideration in the new calculation period, came to these extraordinary expenses."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incident in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs, has spared the waste water systems over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will remain precarious in the long run, especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage treatment association in order to not extend these facilities because it is a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect is criticized as an asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-blunt, self-centred tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All abortions are brought to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When a filter proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon by Asians - "Yellow hawk."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced rattoos reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student, whose tweet on the photos has been widely distributed, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and mild."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the descending extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pitcher.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats Filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an article on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that ramming-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership false ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the real conditions on the ground, announced an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committees, Secret Service Commitees and the Armed Forces Commites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically picked up by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened with CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct reference to government tips given under Obama's instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015 many Central Command's press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "presented the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second-largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-year 2014 to mid-2015, Central Command points out the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports is underway by the Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence community released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff representative house, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "reported morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House with the Centcom analysts with regard to a" "" "specific political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon inspector, who had been picked up after complaints from CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the Inspector General's investigations are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have differing opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls allegations of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker pointed out that contrary to the statements made by the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its overly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the field-hockey of the women, a showdown with Britain stands before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having fired three goals over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever to have done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last play of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch, leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the National Team, and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "Bam said." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work ensum in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rout the roar completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was in the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a fast-paced relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the wristguard to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsor and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in Olympic round gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally accepted: air pips, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely aware that many who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there was never a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unenlightened person for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist cittern of its never-ending interval - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring Winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and scars) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official" "" "Olympiad" "", "they are rated according to performance, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in the TV broadcast: the world or the Olympic Centre.</seg>
<seg id="28">The target-oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a little tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The pole vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and finals of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectivity of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts have recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia were pushing for violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that umpteen protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian just about to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos being circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights authority now calls for a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa, and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks in the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constrained, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisonment, killed or driven into the depths of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options out of protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seewm Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stranglehold regarding power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less defeated in recent years, could use the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hiding under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave an indication that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian high-nationals from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to co-ordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was specially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and render them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemaram Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Different from Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailindariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such a turmoil was in 2005 after thousands of protesters protested against elections which, according to analysts, apparently were misguided by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal malfunction of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amperic city, carried out by Tigray and hatred towards Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by anging that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period, to the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump behaved in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegations were completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling exchange values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to vage his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump accepted an even more cherished note, as his survey values have declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often uses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention over the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has put his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent intercessors, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind bandages, completely false, and so it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by allowing them to take control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of having to face each of his words and be taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he scorned the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a small cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's shop, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people robbed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also a re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A reanimated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings such as capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural acacces.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated delicatessen on Fifth Avenue, like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Waterturtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding as dessert.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "" "said Jane Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">COs last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Brickman told her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "An ongoing meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, snorkeling snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture did eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter stopped hopping, this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," says Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were tons of peanut bread, liver cheese and poppy bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and something cheaper, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rockers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "traces the paths with which the country went around to be no longer the" "" "Schlaraffenland" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense topic," "" "Coe understood why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious dishes like breads and casserole were staple food, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food residue," the brickman noticed that chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the central point of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends have been tried as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over flavor or even healthy food.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular additive at lunch," "" "says Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the recipes of the house.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and to meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke as the million-million man from the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had called him to conserve an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House brought out the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country was back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, "said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of wasting food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>

<seg id="47">There was the wind-bag incident.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland Harks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland Harks only get their offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark floats along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average just 1,220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a beneficiary for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionary biologist predicted long that Greenland hair will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland Harks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers are aware of the lifestyle of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion was measured by six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another one swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers, which torpedo from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-arks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth was to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the lenticular nucleus withholds a small excess of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lenticular core, all larger Greenland-arks had normal carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland hairs with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on grass-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal stirs warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar-strants from the sea sorbent unit of Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romsander journey of all the strants in the next two years, the Oberministerial round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Bischofsburg city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and Hathias, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before the pastor sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and distributed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, each accompanied by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely made a rest in order to sing together a song from a dedicated pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights the parsonage houses of the local parish were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of the stages for a tasty and delicious dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tags on this stage, one stepped on the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to drop some 500 metres in the heat of the heat and climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it was on the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Deliberately facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thanks to a small impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Minis by the operator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner last night in the men's team-Sprint in the velodrome of Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the yen made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the runways in London in March despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner win an Olympic course in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and retired Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up an Olympic race and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 Triumph at Kenny's and Hoys side, Hindes said he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to British rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such a superb victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like the UK flags on the Tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only contest of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-way four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won Gold in London 2012 was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie archivest of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK Team is relying on his strong track team to dominate the middle age of the Olympic Games and to bring a medal to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sex and mobbing reproaches as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GBs, who has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting plant in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus all supply contracts will be lifted, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years is proceeding in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "up to 2000 jobs in the" "" "Alcoa" "" "plant in Portland are at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the point of Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting plant," the company announced.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL also said that the contracts are so-called" "" "securing transactions" "", "which should have come into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to income in fiscal year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The potential impact on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual report amounting to $187 million in anticipation of cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" "" "ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "does not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if it is yet another explanation why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn against possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland spends some 600 megawatts of electricity per year around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [current market].</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estée Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ended with a classical turn: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the cliché act of almost every episode episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in that publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were 615 pages of advertisement from the 832 pages of the rampart).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still seeping through the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities, the modeled" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of its generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat-Video (even though it all applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenny's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenny's position in the world of fashion was always a little strained.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them as "the mistlettes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling up again when the news came out with the show Jenners on the vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to lay around on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estée Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sold her pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inaction after it was told that in February her campaign leader for North Carolina aimed a firearm on a staff while travelling in a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in a bill of indictment, which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "ordini announced to have been waiting for months to regulate the matter internally before he realized that" "" "that would not happen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign leader, Earl Philip, drew a pistol, put his right finger on the trigger, and curled the run into Vincents Kniekehle, "he stated in his indictment.</seg>
<seg id="6">After having appealed to the local and regional campaign management, he found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phillip, he was indicted in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "weapons do not have to be fired to do damage," "" "declares Bordini." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment came only two days after the Republican candidate triggered a turmoil when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearm owners and weapons friends - should take action if its rival should be elected Hillary Clinton and appoint judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign clearly indicated that the media would have pulled out his words from the context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordinis complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was not to be reached for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to contact Philip did likewise fail.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new jobs, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding lifts is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamassing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable once again according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus could once have erased similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow moving of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to harbour life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus is exposed to the sun's daytime side for almost two months," "" "explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planets scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabited, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and their water vapor has been burned out by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejades star enhouses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rotation-periods are related to planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stares, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning to the quickest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars poke large quantities of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnet-fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler accepts the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots --.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping sample, weight lifters Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">The athlete had won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have been announced for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifeber Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the athletics competitions already critically acclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands a full cooperation with the investigations," "" "commented Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Court of Justice CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS responsible for the sanction of the athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive sample fell by thanks to Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, there should be no EPO for blood doping.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have had a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's prime minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported to the public with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, about all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, the case of Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation banned the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic doping, including the nation-nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in the swimming-sport, the previous offsets in China were also taken care of between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m free, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt on the French Radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping cheaters," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positively by the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimulant Trimetazidine, but had to wait only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: as perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies reported in the past twelve months at least once, partially victims of an attack using blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations made by Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling quick evolution of the malicious software," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of blackmail presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware arrives.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies paying, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, establish freely accessible support websites or unlock for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must sometimes negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "in view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" "" "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackheads.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have created so far by which malware itself, advice and additional tools have been purchased for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will be made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebb survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement alone, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price escalations," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take up entirely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon chipper conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could control an internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the Motorway bringer</seg>
<seg id="2">It is stowed regularly on the straddle road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the legal deflection should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic jams when they travel via the motorway Abringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The state-run road construction will extend on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wesel Straße to the right-wing track by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then drive directly from Hammer Street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic divides early on, whereby the overall sequence is improved on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit was the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder is driving the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backlog reaches the bridge across the Alberian Way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is that the needle fleece on the B 51 is just before the exit Wesel Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only channelled in one lane via the motorway bridge.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent find their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeder, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, thus an I / O disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the diarrhoea that many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind them can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, the sleep problem is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in case of depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc may lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and may start to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbe a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised by the day should go to the doctor, advises her.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - in question.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any resident sleeping doctor in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, she advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the investigation in the sleep laboratory, doctors, for example, advise snoring with breathing problems, in cases of abnormal fatigue, sleep converters or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance disturbance, says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disguise, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts on: regular bedtime and stand-up times, do not sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, stop drinking alcohol and don't look at night at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolar.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly" has jumped to the front of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished as soon as possible, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, be preferred by burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the tenants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel pronounced itself several times for a hard action by the police against the project, called the "No-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks of official assertions with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocking parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers commissioned the unknown homeowners to renovate the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about the late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens lie in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children, are mostly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who desperately wanted to seek police protection from the vandaliatory left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house-occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse, close to the Riga Dome.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and partly occupied by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll planners from around the world: with them now residents from GDR times and former house-owned squatters share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them at fixed discs or newly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "" "left-handed violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offences such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes constitute property damage, which tend to encounter new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, uncertainty cannot be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as far as violence is concerned, it is important: the 94" "" "people are their neighbours, they are certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga-Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important to her that the inhabitants got their street back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away: due to the faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "finally, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - people who are not so good are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "but what can we do if someone never listen?" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For newcomers who are fond of color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub area, complaining bad about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee agency</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group of refugees, administration, authorities and who else is still involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group suggested that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the unfinished Wollmilksau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less mocking than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities change from the Board of Directors to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work so far, unless you rely on private apartments, thus Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be replenished, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides a permanent home, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But action does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the trial is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually find the feeling that he can't help in Urbach no one can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems too, says customer honest," "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always also to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer says quite clearly," "" "which may be naive to many" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants might come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher have already been busy to integrate the previous people rationally.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
