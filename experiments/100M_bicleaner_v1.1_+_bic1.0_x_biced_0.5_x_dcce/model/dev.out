Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and den@@ oun@@ ces Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deal between the two continues to deterior@@ ate due to the deal promoted by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election .
in an emergency call Professor is admitted to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb did the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ er died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre @-@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he entered Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , having 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing some years ago .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ er , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ st Night at night 5 . September last time after lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before an angry audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the University of State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ wache &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the university choir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb had the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
To@@ ys R Us states that there are not so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plan to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired at Christmas time in 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
while the holidays itself are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realized that the seat next to me is empty and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN head again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France at the si@@ delines of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey data showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys down , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the past eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the Real Estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey data suggesting that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp Most values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University pointed out that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the First Elec@@ toral State of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they raise their hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week , four of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp guidance , while anti @-@ trust support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp picks up the majority support .
he has scored 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
yet Tru@@ mp is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive Hez@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and destroy the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp apparently will do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can constitu@@ ents , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish den@@ ying . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which specific locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top dwelling places , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two@@ fold scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympic Games in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where in the third attempt , Guardi@@ ola will finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who passed a shot of the world champion as a f@@ lange .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without glit@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they courage@@ ously ran to work with their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ ceful .
the attacks were introduced too often by shifting to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympic Games storm Ide@@ ye Brown beat Poland &apos;s head@@ ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 34 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their habit@@ ual game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put needle pun@@ ks .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was a victim of torture .
so about when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola was able to defend a four @-@ leg@@ ged chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final qualifying , said the Chief Executive Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to do something else from it , it &apos;s already vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 54 . ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put on it .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavarian fans apparently prov@@ oked the followers of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with impact attacks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
anyone who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the amount of 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 % .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly infl@@ amed g@@ ums in smokers .
not clari@@ fied whether smoking is also increasing the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Master H@@ einer Boeing vom DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to a high age .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking raises the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late anti@@ quity
archaeological findings were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have dug itself skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city area of Cologne , the museum is always drawn as a specialist department for archaeological soil conservation .
in the third part of the Rhin@@ bou@@ levard the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , who probably belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train recorded
after a young woman has died at the train station in Honduras , the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei asks the people for help .

EU Commission is propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
to raise the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation is significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
until now , the parties agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ections to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court according to their own information .
there could , for example , clarify any disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) requested above all are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism that allows companies to take damage to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in initial comments anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised in particular that it is not supposed to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ angry ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission included fundamental points in the reform that Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association business Europe warned that the economies of the economy would limit the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde was eag@@ erly awaited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture and create David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from near .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ grund stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ack@@ able within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements regarding the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour is propos@@ ing to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised another politi@@ cian says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ ture is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will be subject to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch &quot; Theatre , often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in this .
since it was first broadcast in television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires extensive reforms .

pounds rise through accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound rose sharply according to data showing a rise in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and raised assessments on the time of an increase in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index grew by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ supply of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after reporting a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages will je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster expresses Lebanese on Pot@@ to@@ k idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat has put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to register the Lebanese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay therefore doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Met@@ cash ki@@ cks off soil resistance campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ -
met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets increase their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A tra@@ der and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual asset strategy day .
there is much in stake , because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ employed retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost around 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told us that met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contacted us .
IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which is about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operating debt with simultaneous print on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to simultaneously increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to provide IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores with fast @-@ growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs to El@@ an are going to be established and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation between Kyr@@ gios and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbitr@@ ator twice , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f ins@@ ulated a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ac was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to have broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US @-@ US , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had any problem with the other players , he is well trained in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged for his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ rene at the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has made a quick move to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency shelter , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were deported from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an immediate action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation , which was originally planned on Tuesday , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprisonment in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become an entry point in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sts that most emerging economic refugees are looking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also specify higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and accused of crimes committed by the new laws .
authorities are able to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian function@@ aries concluded on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and pressed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 they managed to arrive , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead prior to Ber@@ nie S@@ ander hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 % earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
her support in the men has been significantly reduced , and S@@ anders only res@@ ides here with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has cur@@ tail@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are saying that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger in those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that Clinton enthusi@@ astically supports Clinton , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support also men@@ tions her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president raises potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are in demand of the pres@@ election , who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be her second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate the Democrats for nomin@@ ating the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
just like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate @-@ elections is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important criteria for voters of their party &apos;s prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have opinion of him .
democratic voters of the pres@@ election generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server will continue as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters are happy with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion had deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of ten who say that their views of Clinton are worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights across the country also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes at the helm .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tru@@ mp in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide tru@@ mp in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demographic groups and sur@@ passes tru@@ mp among republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in the p@@ olls - he lands at 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side screens for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing fans to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the peak of 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a bush@@ y ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to one goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gling his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt power .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment concerning the murder of third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for serious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ iced her affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rate of interest comes , and the house se becomes stag@@ gering , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
thus representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could , however , find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a net interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that published Bob Dol@@ l , CEO of asset management at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and the yield thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that were not before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were preparing to raise the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and in front of rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ment heights very quickly after the onset of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a net interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase the bond yields dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones knows that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit tension has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and large scale , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ bbing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial rivals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they were only im@@ itating The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the show The Voice and said that it was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from his commercial rivals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would be far ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ate the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for the promotion of commercial rivals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took The Voice to the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sts that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC @-@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose by slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back up to 2000 , this has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers started making purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may possibly experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites pl@@ ung@@ ed .
experts believe Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop shopping .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was issued a little over £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident Get@@ ting killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ z@@ ee collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction on the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Station of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane should not have stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the government Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ch , which will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a desc@@ ended son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries .
other compar@@ isons get half of this amount .

because Br@@ its are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry home @-@ based jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain said that a large increase in the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 selling points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the sales when the Group under@@ scored the cost of closing shops .
due to the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the accused were used in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is about 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
this fact was separated from the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ miss@@ al of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association did not come into existence at any time .
the sports officials would only have charged expendi@@ tures and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( RD . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on the club further or block us ? , &quot; one of the accused told one of the accused , in the B@@ read based large audi@@ tor of the financial office .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot out money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security for the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
so I paid a part of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
that &apos;s why l@@ ump @-@ switching and not detail bookings also appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts administered the two def@@ endants , &quot; said the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been posted in detail , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for finance education , it is important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused stated .
this bank account was based on the name of the second accused , and , according to its statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the public prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , he justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ endant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the accused .
they were no longer kept in compliance with an audit in which everything was considered correct .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all correc@@ tions are made in cash , and he said in his statement from his hom@@ etown of international markets to the Bank in Blei@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer giant will build further jobs when the company spl@@ its up .
the sub@@ missions at the US computer terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the company generated with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto is now split up : the computer and print business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a renewed dis@@ appointing PC market as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more shops online .
all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total breakdown of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the Anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct participation of German soldiers to combat operations in Iraq , however , would be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly clas@@ sed : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 per cent showed itself appro@@ v@@ ingly .
the fact that other countries are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
a cooperation with the Syrian rulers Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad declined 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
the exhibition focuses on networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility by the end of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the Auto Association V@@ DA have about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police used a number of refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a police line was formed behind it and a water @-@ thro@@ wer was standing behind the police officers .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and apparently wounded woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees assembled in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokesman of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reuters found out that a little more than half , which was the last week of view that the F@@ ed will continue to do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University leaving excuse
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he was shot on someone and someone killed .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give him .
lamb was no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman that loved me ever . &quot;
after writing the note , lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years , was described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ er had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb drove his car to the side , fled at foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , as he gives his life on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor was also supposed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
however , with the pilot union there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the budget of Euro@@ wings .
the target of real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline stated on Wednesday .
among other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Management Team for Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot agreement of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as quickly as possible with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the pilot supply of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept is background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that the Lufthansa Cargo is reloc@@ ating to the Group &apos;s own budget line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; morning train in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger can be seen in the Künstler@@ haus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play Mon@@ el@@ ang because of Double Fra@@ k@@ tur
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and exclude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w fell into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an i@@ vory gauge .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was saying : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the England defender , with the European Championship in France , has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a F@@ oul@@ spiel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , re@@ prints a content release of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy , called T@@ ed , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so much familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ ought stri@@ cken once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s Choice District Office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully further acquisitions turn out for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not perform such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is primarily a team man .
the question of how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sionist gets to put his mark is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I record high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would perform an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spinning centers that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ lah Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain from the EU ) could gain Zul@@ u if the economy falls into a l@@ ump in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour , or the TU@@ C , who fought heavily on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at che@@ er recently said that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes an outside Britain outside of the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a fade @-@ in force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will plu@@ ck up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and the pseudo non @-@ nation@@ als possessing the majority of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ bid constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never been able to draw it out .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly flap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error back then and today .
it can take but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I think it &apos;s friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wil@@ dest hit by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men everyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in it , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell became a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and dep@@ uties after all the reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV round the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a ne@@ sting site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for whom the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start of Monday , which called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; exceedingly wind@@ y foundation , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criterion decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Product ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ lined the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International reports beforehand .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which also provide an industry @-@ financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the t@@ abo@@ o line of p@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK sender .
he critici@@ zed the BBC to place publicly @-@ legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from Sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give its production to programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why an reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show that what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think we all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who are for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC to check out its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and enter alliances with the commercial broad@@ caster alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified ne@@ ural systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : reading and writing brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically altered the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down by an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the promotion for the weapons trade fair - through a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic delicate corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the open@@ work of bright colours and animation it remains strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegal in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors s@@ wir@@ l fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the belief of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I recall the ten@@ se smile of those I have been angry - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student resi@@ dences extends from easily ner@@ ven@@ er@@ ably to absolutely horri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie up : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken the sab@@ bath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , movie night venues and community meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and put their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow soldier is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and might associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping whenever you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to cope with it as my room@@ mate , who added her milk a pur@@ se to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter for them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ cr@@ ative music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep for two hours before leaving her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , if you are a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you have to take part in it , separate yourself and see it every day , and perhaps experience how to bring all together friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart is your own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an el@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good foot@@ ing is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fails someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put into the freezer - but un@@ pack your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds rice @-@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one puts people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly dra@@ gged my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking lot regulation .
cre@@ amy .
it is still under@@ represented , who creates three flats in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .

but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ lian : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system released when the Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message telling the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush comes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more impro@@ b@@ able due to the ampli@@ fication of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may be switched off half@@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

you should also make sure you &apos;ve seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and to protect themselves if they do . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system .
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve seasonal races so far and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a vap@@ or bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing membership to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held himself more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein received .
thus it is possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
S@@ alu@@ di and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new agency at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice will immediately get information on questions such as health care insurance or health and nursing insurance .
for years we established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too rarely many services of the banks are not used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consulting , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the S@@ alu@@ di was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as stroke prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the sen@@ iors centre and the S@@ alu@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
S@@ alu@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sen@@ iors centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of S@@ alu@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus continued on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus won an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the show .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 80s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz into the Austrian Theatre Museum .

in the middle of the middle of Bremen , meadow could cut the hair , when he saw how outside a parking guard exhibited a bill for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meadow then stor@@ med out of the store , insul@@ ted the officer and accused her of fine fin@@ es in front of her feet , as reported in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ or@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men scre@@ amed the young boy and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al burst of nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the last one went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s were examined with the aid of a stroke pitch .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
until now only a v@@ ague perpetr@@ ator description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and don@@ ors to sign up under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ im U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side with half a position in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fel@@ low@@ ships met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll years ago , who is currently completing her specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz County and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both intern@@ s , want to settle down as a resident doctor .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of € 50@@ 000 is provided by the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2,000 patients come into practice for Fel@@ lows in every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another home doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had found himself , she would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation , is still looking at the familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning lady from the rock floor .
with their departure end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pressed ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and will be happy to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for Internal Affairs Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ ridors for the refugees .
the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to limit its borders for refugees but not factories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government r@@ ushed , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to drive past the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could resort to the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ ge Croatia to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ b media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was allowed people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , some 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has happened so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually result in a shift in the current Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ distance route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; full possibilities for border control . &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently received a good certificate from the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
around 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm down on Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local ophthalm@@ ologist in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

with the information captured , insi@@ der shops will have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders can ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused were continued in the case .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is a lively bustle .
people do their worries , in part fast pac@@ ing , partly lei@@ surely stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ al@@ os at the parade ground .
keeping city lanes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large plates each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped to draw attention to its twenty @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteer workers .
while man@@ ch interfer@@ es spontaneously with the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the proposition for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end will come to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ association carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the boards , however , it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the opening of the people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research surve@@ yed analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the body transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ stor@@ e@@ yed sitting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two@@ fold mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets may make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which de@@ votes itself to the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
but financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage number rose by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in slow@@ ing down the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the compla@@ ins of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world ended up at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , and the Dow is now about 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation when interest should be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates for an interest rate rise in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its lending by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should take time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
ja , Chin@@ at@@ own
the warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday they are doing it at asylum seekers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , the whole of the lessons is different than at a real school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects pregnant women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn @-@ over construction at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the construction work was unanim@@ ously agreed without any major discussions .
previously , among other things , the committee had , among other things , adopted an application for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid plan of development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form relating to the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why we have a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which is intended for energetic reasons , is supposed to be different from the plan of development - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the type of roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude sports promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Board of Directors for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s county , the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and that will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff are informed about the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree that both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
land@@ lady J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the supervisory board , ad@@ mits ru@@ mo@@ urs about what the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß couldn &apos;t say it , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day psychology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ balls of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Li@@ ons are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) .
in Wuppertal , the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite , however , there is no occasion for arrogan@@ ce .

Jag@@ land@@ fall with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police said .
after a shooting he suffered severe injuries and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly it could happen to the accident .
the crime police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the interro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up , killing young people and throwing their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the Public Prosecutor and the police on Wednesday .
on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who , in fact , conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police station to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead bodies into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the dock , the investig@@ ators put him to the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclusions about the conditions of action are to bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Buil@@ dings Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year .
thus , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant cuts in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany is shooting a residential deficit that grows bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ ,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compla@@ ined .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of flat @-@ room flats .
young adults continued to stay longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the noise on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Buil@@ dings Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
thus , the basic income tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments may be suspended for a period of time .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters at the Kf@@ W State Bank is now well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the remaining 300 million euros had already been declared on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
there is practically no passing to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to the reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , however , after the closure of the border hardly more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the decision on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws att@@ est to the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country were sentenced to death .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees staying there .
practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the reception areas in the border location was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuation to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday we were busy clearing up , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ oned across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
first of all , we used the un@@ hoped @-@ for guests once , with a snack and a drink .
we immediately said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from one ICE to a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , so that after the short announcement , the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try over the border .
the regional train was completed before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a branch @-@ back @-@ run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ ot to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to build structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor moved highly officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ i District of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for people seeking refuge in the face of the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the coming winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ firm districts
Conrad has all his hands to do with the support of the refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first tak@@ e@@ off centre has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a great whi@@ rl@@ wind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates a demand of 8@@ 5,000 tran@@ quarters in the he@@ ur@@ iger year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to supply the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already held talks with the provincial leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that district employers have to observe a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the tor@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad justi@@ fies Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man who doesn &apos;t speak the truth without further ado . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ asion is his most important weapon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic costs as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , the search for a district has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz is calling for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently unable to take these measures without taking these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the head of the city council is critici@@ zing the partition of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has cor@@ rupted the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be shut down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany for the time being .
the prot@@ ectors , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once demanded more enhanced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T Chief , Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of floor space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
ven@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point in the new shop .
in fact Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to move the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she now has grown in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets of 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been modified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought Br@@ eit into the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I feel the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the specialist with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bic , bit@@ ing journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire have come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ eats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to it over -@@ zig verti@@ ces .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their C@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous youngsters , among whom also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz belongs to Tru@@ mp .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the don@@ or , she says .
so , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the investors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate group was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz belonged then .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he does , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Grand@@ pa was bor@@ rowed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dis@@ soci@@ ated to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp will come ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ vor@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended at a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , who was interviewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 movi@@ ego@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in recent months , Today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August , Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these mor@@ nings more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father , who decides to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
average average 6@@ 20,000 Hot @-@ Se@@ at .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia makes N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute not being able to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets exposed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may accidentally have given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made her clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a bo@@ under like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday did 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports journalist Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his twisted catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters are demanding the setting up of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ rang @-@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools when there are not so many new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get ver@@ dic@@ ts in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land Holiday Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire of Free voters dar@@ es to be held until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Syrian leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary high @-@ school secondary school was tested for three to four years .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the German stock market has closed with profits after a long stretches of tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory and nerv@@ ousness .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which finally promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ Da@@ x average score gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid gains also enjoyed trading posts in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index ranked approximately 1 percent in the Plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to be on the spot as far as the interest decision in the US and the big decline in the appointment on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate about the loads from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros of provisions .
the German government has denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future Waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers by the autom@@ akers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s mer@@ its were by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on stock exchange listed on the stock exchange securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ an@@ ten@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week for certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alisation of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and living is planned , but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post Office of Youth .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , that is the name of the city .
which investor in@@ quired , be not yet clear .
no contracts were signed in accordance with this agreement .
the city of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the land , which is located on the ring road / corner big street , already a few months ago bought and the building had to be torn down .
H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ gli@@ ders are still worried - they fear the end of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , s@@ ling@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are now near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which pro@@ found@@ ly accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on to the offensive by the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in the discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called for the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member for the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open .
there are no operators yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts bi@@ dding campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling of $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of making an announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled from Kab@@ ul with her family , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey many dark railway and bus journeys included hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also flee from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
report by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of loss @-@ loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight surgery longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has been effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital filed data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely dis@@ connected and 28 % of them were partially affected .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass Sur@@ gery group lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ enter@@ ec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people undergoing an obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth for years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author is raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria engaged in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase in intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of swal@@ lowing strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children can intentionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube demonstrate how adolescents can only drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry s@@ cent@@ ed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was put into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally responsible for an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated her in the twin medical center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trauma , because the girl fell by alcohol and had hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario were killed by swal@@ lowing hands of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
staff of health authorities suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been listed as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the en@@ acted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously dismissed by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show any highlights of Celtic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ ger .
you are talking about the old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ estate games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic fighting needs to fight , but the Norwegian boss sha@@ kes to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points lead clearly ahead of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we need to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defence was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said , and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ks
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es are happy to be &quot; uns@@ ett@@ led &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen has had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cords in order to see a seventh consecutive league win , which brought them a lead of five points ahead Celtic at the top of the table due to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no squ@@ ad that has won everything , in cups or songs that have won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it continues to rise in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the UK@@ s by 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed the drain

why I will witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good police officer negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he targeted the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that she had performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging bun@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had to let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave as cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw out his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the beaten master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been that night .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it had it so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits rivals because of claims about ring fighting back
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called for criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the NR@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high season win in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely cover@@ t note to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that they were concentrated only on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried to be struck by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring battles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focal point , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting soccer , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the match Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks or are not points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee deposit to Dru@@ gs
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu and deposited in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security together in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the urgent declarations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ob@@ serves his Australian and his Serbian passport , registers with the police on a daily basis and stays at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left at the last moment , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab has torn apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used concepts for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg argued against the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the im@@ permanent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he did .
on 25 January this year , Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June of this year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael wa@@ ver@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was included in the list of sexual crimes before the judgment date .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers do@@ dge to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people more often at smaller border cross@@ ings from fear of discovery and arrest .
out on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dust on the German side .
here they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration .
compared to the weekend started on Wednesday , much more refugees arrived on Wednesday at the Munich main train station .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone to 8 : 00 pm , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : extension of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest expected &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm holes in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure zone over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart divided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er circle with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hours kilometres can be expected .
on Friday we can look back on the sun again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the motor@@ ways at the IAA show their innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to list all movements in the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment in August alone , according to the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel offers an entrance below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which will start at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ essi@@ ans also offer other diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors &quot; Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan de@@ posit@@ or wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti perfectly adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s data at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger mainly applied to the front panel : the radi@@ ator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed spot@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was mainly modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary of the Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open feet , had been moved to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant , due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin , failed .
but the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
they see the human dignity of the man wounded .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wor@@ ding of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , man un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a det@@ ain@@ ee had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff stayed for three months from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ siveness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have arrived because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed for lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is going on in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing accounts fall out of the rental price agreement each year , and these particularly advantageous apartments will also apply for refugees .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to th@@ ist@@ le , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to residence asylum seekers to a residence .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking in German . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the king &apos;s way to work integration according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ libr@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case of the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) but now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ er@@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law if they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter basically don &apos;t get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ le persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , calling for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to develop a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic charity which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
duties include duties on the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain controls .
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Ba@@ yr@@ ische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be a topic of the whole society much more than today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , pressing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a universal equality law .
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and stakeholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like anti @-@ racism law commit Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , says Police President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacity , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery wants to susp@@ end all the newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards .
achievements could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s offices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
however , many refugees would also be helped by more general medical appointments in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disability , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly different diseases of the disease , German doctors would come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctor , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , many refugees even were doctors .
in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and again ex@@ ept ex@@ ams .
according to estimates of the Federal psycho@@ therapy chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attack and death fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in social offices mostly non @-@ cler@@ ical or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the circus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage .
for more than 33 years , the circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift to am@@ a@@ ying lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasized the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosmopolitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates audiences with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their handi@@ craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to get up with ease .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
except through numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger tips and arti@@ stry .
balancing with the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst likes to take a stand : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , is read by the eyes of every desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the upper@@ most command : good for the animals .
especially on the zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there might be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or more 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. to 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe considers the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also viol@@ ated by the claims of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ine .
in the last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of Parliament that immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party held by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chair and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it dis@@ integrates a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electric plants and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and , in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd insp@@ ected 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , most vulnerable to injury .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give players who need it to take a small break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured at the Richter scale 3.3 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is convinced that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to question the men who need help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms established that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football pitch in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often with@@ hold to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone pastoral care I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ suffering has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider @-@ status about the phone may help people in moments of desper@@ ation also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the setting to celebrate the day totally new scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ son Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
Maria met for less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ u@@ ts as PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish masters , since they do not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but rather an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class play by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could last a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps poles in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered a little bit of attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had spent less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate at last fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ yer scored his sixth season opening after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had spotted a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from the very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the quali@@ fier games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two times Club World Champion , twice a World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was depar@@ ting from Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns would run with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ finals of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the red off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protag@@ onist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not in filling the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nun , beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said her direction &quot; in the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured inclu@@ sions .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record silent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season final there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had replaced the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ IS@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three races possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the Bull@@ pen and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung along the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked much better off in the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three races in the rear end at the end of seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ gee , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run in the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was beating a double play .
having added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Wall managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three of us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injuries list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first time , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scoring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injuries list due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the injuries list to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who came to it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden r@@ ushed in on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several Spor@@ th@@ allen of the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , who were responsible for the first recording of the government of the government responsible for the first time .
because of the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in Spor@@ th@@ allen .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
the concrete figures were not called them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries with the initial absorption and distribution of people more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the League will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hour deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection are be@@ holding this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective could not stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was positively shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to lock the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking alternative routes across Romania , Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ ells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon til@@ ts easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
this pi@@ vot@@ al movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in 2006 at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
Ram@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to wai@@ ve Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association .
at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain .
according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a standardis@@ ed professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive mann first .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on the head .
in contrast to his first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor to beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

the US parcel service U@@ PS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 grants for Christmas business in the United States .
the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS divided on Tuesday .
especially drivers are sought .
last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 aid in the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex hit previous years to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the next night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ ur@@ sday the hair dryer is partly infl@@ ated by the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the top of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys at night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn wind up Thursday morning in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjoining mid@@ ell@@ and , and in the mountains , even or@@ cans of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday dry F@@ öhn ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away at the slope of the Alps .
here rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some over 100 litres of rain per square meter , which has already fallen in large amounts of rainf@@ all over the last days .
on Thursday morning , the blow blow out , as a result a cold front rolls over Switzerland with a powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east .
together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my and the temperatures go back considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north @-@ autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the place , in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a seed ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the dis@@ miss@@ al .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt made for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motives has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the particular subjects , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
thus , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , in current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing has always happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to be able to carry me back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art back to more importance in fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is characterised today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I did not care to complete the Bible completely , but chose the most important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture Bible was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for mo@@ ans both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn draw near
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model ground level for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused a loss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill deported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first church leader Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still going to happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified involvement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the sharp situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy to help tackle the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no one can say that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation of refugees in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ ery office and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could help and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Nier@@ s@@ bach on the si@@ delines of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal government also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot sleeves instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations was great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will present a total of 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the German Federal Government ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses one eye in case of accident
the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell into a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then went out tow@@ ed to the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...

at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely crum@@ bled .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal prince Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has been open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement of fellow players R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants lead @-@ ahead for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy change@@ over to digital radio .
for testing new technology a test track is currently being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to apply for example internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study evaluated the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator de@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in at all in 20 years , 31 percent believe at all .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
however , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the digital state of Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give the control over the entire drive on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status , the Düsseldorf will only want to strike in singles on the title fight between September 25 and October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ strainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the betting list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look aw@@ fully human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations by the French designer , who , among other things , became the star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Thi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed total artwork , for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ st the dolls , for example , a Sty@@ list was dedicated .
14 tons of material conveyed the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , agile fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but could keep the clothes .

the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example to produce blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ors P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is again important again .
in the early hours of the P@@ lau@@ chen tip , fashion played a major role , then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
we already have half of all orders with us .
Mo@@ esch@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
exports are also weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ Saxony University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter has re@@ opened the historic snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine stops small glob@@ ules at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ chen tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
as a result , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; is not a new movie but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical girl girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director notes : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI insi@@ sts to open the economy wider to the world
the economy must open wide to support growth , &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday , a group commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi said .
the Leadership Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified that do not come into question for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus depri@@ ve consumers of a much higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization of Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are lifted by one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly stressed with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish at present 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ ones is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic for humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its website with respect to the current maximum levels , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury comes primarily through coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written request by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity produced in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and surface @-@ overl@@ apping &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
