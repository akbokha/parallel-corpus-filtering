&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied during the implementation of the provisions of part I on safety measures .
the aim of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junc@@ ture by the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the checks by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone which is not specified for a specific time period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified concentrations .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear material according to this agreement is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preserved , processed , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stock , and the stock quantity ;
B ) the evaluation of the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of the uncertainty of the measurement ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and changes of this inventory for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) Ret@@ ur@@ ns , which ensure that the accounting practices and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) If ur@@ anium or th@@ orium material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel cycle , is introduced into the States , the community of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material unless it is in@@ stituted for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the core @-@ fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the prerequisites mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met , the association is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , so that the organization and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are con@@ sensual , that this core material is practically not re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards following this agreement :
a ) special cle@@ av@@ age material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to hed@@ ging measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided the total amount of core material released in the states is no longer at any given time due to this Article in the states .
a ) a total of one kilogram of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safety measures according to this agreement , the provisions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures are made on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in the individual how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements entered into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention .
based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a summar@@ ised inventory of the entire core material in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation )
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by the general resource center problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to the entry into force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will enable its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean ties to ensure a broad and well @-@ balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds made and used by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is governed by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions should be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic deb@@ tors of the Member State , which shall pay upon request in the currency of the concerned state in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction and to be deposited in the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the agreement on 1 January 1979 or at another date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments before the above mentioned dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school notes , in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and compensate for the special transaction in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan conditions without a discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expand@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices applied for the proceeds of the organization financed by the organization .

apart from section 4 , special transactions loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten years each .
the transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that it maintains .
each transaction loan is defined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or delivered ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , on the basis of what the administrator has specified at the time of the loan granted , could be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of a special loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments from a special transaction are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator .
until the complete assignment of all the transaction loans , the administrator has been teaching the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the review by the directors .
during the time of the withdrawal of the transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker informs the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC shall promptly send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are apparent from the account statements , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out from the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States .
the EEC and the administrators are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete edition of the means of the special interaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special interaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation have agreed upon , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total amount of the total amount of the transaction loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is returned and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications together with a No@@ tification on the regular approval of the agreement by the EEC .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two juris@@ dic@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter for amend@@ ment of Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT issued the following IN@@ FOR@@ MA@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large trial facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; Shared Company J@@ ET , &quot; referred to in Chapter V of Eur@@ atom Con@@ tract .
for several years Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
as far as practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to speed up their respective research projects , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable any contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both side research , and accordingly the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it is expanded or altered after examination by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that there may be new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will take place in the place of the program listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the Third States , with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right of access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association set out in Article 2 of this Agreement , the contracting parties will conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those specified between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved at the time of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the date of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Market J@@ ET whose Stat@@ utes are accepted .
Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , whose goal is to fall within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the organs assigned to carry out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement shall , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the aims of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * activities in the interests of both parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments described in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are requested .
the Advisory Groups that submit to the VG Research proposals with regard to the funds granted to the Eur@@ atom Programme provide the best possible scientific results , taking this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories participating .

the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character .
the VG position on the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of human resource exchange .
the representatives of both parties have an effect on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set on an annual amount to which Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of the Eur@@ atom programme is equal to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established .
in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects an amount to the Common Enterprise J@@ ET , which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Market .
the financial contribution which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of work within the framework of the Association Agreement and the Agreement on Human Resources Exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to the financing of the work undertaken by the relevant tre@@ aties .
the commission divi@@ des the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year in question .
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial advisory
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion bill of invoice ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future provision for the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
at any stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without the need for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their possible extension the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first bills are not made before the end of one month after the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taken into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ S at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate applicable to the application could achieve a maximum which corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in slaughter weight ( 1 ) .

the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention stocks on frozen meat are not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the regulation of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb and from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular corresponds to Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .

the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed according to the collective agreement .
the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of these agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set at number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year will be set in proportion to the total annual amount and will take account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the foundation of the European Economic Community and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .

a re@@ agent to determine blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen containing the antibody or any other substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended mode recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of the blood cells flow in the overall volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set out for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to determine the blood group of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are worked out at present .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of Internation@@ ally Units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ stit@@ cher , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow .
the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ atory or a state stem preparation in International Units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per m@@ l. according to the definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the International Standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should be maintained at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ tist form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ v@@ edly approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ox@@ ides over a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to lead to specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein Nit@@ rogen per ml flu@@ ke@@ able or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in a flu@@ ent form or after dissolution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents specified for international exchange of blood group determination should not be artificial as possible , at least until an international agreement has been established through a uniform system .
re@@ agents to determine blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is likely that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used to determine blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are grouped according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin .
each tank is available in black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ charging ,

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D Ser@@ um is derived from the blood of one or more individuals imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective returns , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for the export and the dispatch process must be met by the copies provided for these form@@ alities .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the individual proceedings shall coinci@@ de .
( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or contra@@ ventions , customs authorities of these countries ask each other for request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The administrative assistance can be denied or rejected in whole or in part , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would interfere with its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
