<seg id="696">The aim of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missiles for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence from such a juncture by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the checks by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone which is not specified for a specific time period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their inspections, the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear material according to this agreement is based on an outline in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are more closely determined and expedient in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preserved, processed, lost, lost or otherwise derived from the stock, and the stock quantity;</seg>

<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by the general resource center problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to the entry into force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will enable its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean ties to ensure a broad and well-balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds made and used by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is governed by the organization as a caretaker, and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions should be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or intrinsic debtors of the Member State, which shall pay upon request in the currency of the concerned state in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction and to be deposited in the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the agreement on 1 January 1979 or at another date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments before the above mentioned dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school notes, in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and compensate for the special transaction in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan conditions without a discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices applied for the proceeds of the organization financed by the organization.</seg>

<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction are made on the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until the complete assignment of all the transaction loans, the administrator has been teaching the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the review by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the withdrawal of the transaction loans, the caretaker informs the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
