this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and in the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied or the melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter appears to activate the recept@@ ors .
because dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to normal@@ ising the activity of the brain , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurring .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases which were suffering from increased distur@@ b@@ ance over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent re@@ occurring , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that were suffering from increased distur@@ b@@ ance with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared .
in all studies , the change in patients &quot; symptoms was examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to the patients who received a placebo .
during the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ b@@ ance , ac@@ ath@@ ema , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( di@@ gest@@ ing ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the on@@ set or after change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder showed no increased suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ counted and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study of fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ den@@ ia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ bo@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical studies showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ op@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ op@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies at the animal , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia was seen in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ din therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ surgical treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium .
in the long @-@ term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma penetration .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der &apos;s respon@@ dents who were referring to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher return rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ din @-@ controlled multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effect on placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , which were partially over 2 weeks not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirr@@ oring , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .

based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ Model@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination round is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ theli@@ al were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ell@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ine pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of apes after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not exceed 6 % of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 of the mean ste@@ ad@@ der state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

A@@ bili@@ fy recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ din @-@ controlled multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 of the mean ste@@ ad@@ der state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ ference of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy processed tab@@ let@@ tes or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in case of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ counted and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a disease include high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness , and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular heart@@ beat or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ den@@ ia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) were used as one @-@ time input intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; poor &quot; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all@@ uring .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with an ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium .
in the long @-@ term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to the ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement observed on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe disability , a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the respon@@ der &apos;s share of response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher return rate for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ din @-@ controlled multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , which were partially over 2 weeks not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirr@@ oring , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effect in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to placebo in comparison to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was applied for 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application no safety @-@ relevant concerns were obtained after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety sp@@ ell@@ ar ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study of 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it should not be applied to patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to the start of the treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other pac@@ lit@@ axel with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ans across the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the treatment of a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neu@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ iles &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during abrasion , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
with sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ artic@@ ulate formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other pac@@ lit@@ axel form@@ ulations ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ er has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven with abrasion , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case patients occur after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tial agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to testify during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect traffic stability and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the addition of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ges , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burns , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ac@@ ic wall , weakness of the mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , abdominal pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active substance which promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ules and stabili@@ ses mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in transm@@ its the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ corneal transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 al@@ umin@@ ous receptor is medi@@ ated and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement by a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at one time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 In patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft bonding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
clearing of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken cau@@ ti@@ ously when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch will provide medical staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • With unique visual representation of the correct application of the product , the product is provided for transport through the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ sec@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections may also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ tin deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inj@@ ected , which makes it capable of forming epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medical drug in a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ ap@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were observed in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to adults without iron deficiency in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pedi@@ atric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and fol@@ dings may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is necessary .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can sometimes be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely mes@@ hed to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and consequ@@ ential symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely mes@@ hed to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ fold increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , is a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be present pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , the reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ump@@ tion , infections or inflammation , blood loss and h@@ emati@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the application of epo@@ e@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in switch should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment efficiency should be considered for a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients intended for a larger or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia prior to the on@@ set of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially for underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it is impossible to exclude that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can consist of an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the co@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F on hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
independent of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the gene@@ tically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ silicone and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content associated with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine in an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared with the controls on the basis of various common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in inspections .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application demonstrated a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours with healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased ) .

134 In animal studies with approximate 20 times of the weekly dose recommended for humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fet@@ al body weight , to del@@ aying the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in fet@@ al mortality .
within the framework of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not above 25 ° C .
141 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
143 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in switch should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .

prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of approval has to provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail shops with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
the holder of approval for the placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is established and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is used in transport .
the holder of approval for the placing on the market comm@@ its himself to the studies and additional actions for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application as well as in accordance with each subsequent update of the Risk Management plan adopted by CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with the receipt of new information that could have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction )
• have suffered a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment - if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis occurred , for example .
you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ) recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cl@@ ots , which re@@ forms again with further treatment .
your doctor may also perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before the treatment begins .
very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will inter@@ rupt your treatment with ab@@ s@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ sec@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of ster@@ ility could be increased .
if you raise or increase potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels return in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ hibition by insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to these findings , the treatment of the blood @-@ arm with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dosage accordingly to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , please keep in mind that ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may , in certain circumstances , have a negative effect on the tumour .
if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is available , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of red hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood hu@@ g ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may also arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equal large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may also arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , also learn how to sp@@ lash out ab@@ se@@ amed themselves under the skin .
heart , heart attack , brain bleeding , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( ane@@ ur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke &apos;s eyes ) and shock@@ ing allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ em@@ ic means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .

Ac@@ load@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like in the throat ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before the first in@@ fusion patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ tu@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pains , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get , Ac@@ credited may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ ou@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study included nearly 8 000 women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood was returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( no other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment medicines ) over a period of three years compared to the patients with placebo .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ tu@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other constitu@@ ents .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be acet@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es as to how the medicine is used , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the launch of Ac@@ ou@@ a in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg per year is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get with Ac@@ credited a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ load@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after Ac@@ tual application .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) in Pati@@ ents with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents with Ac@@ load@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data concerning the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ load@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with acet@@ a by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ load@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available , if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by the use of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after Ac@@ tual Application ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable to ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum @-@ cre@@ atine within 10 days of application was observed with 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were present in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ a in the disease @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to Ac@@ tu@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was commonly reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with acet@@ a and in a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a BM@@ D ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric curves ac@@ las@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures ac@@ las@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years that resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic crest .
in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the trab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of trab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone tissue markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of the study .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ load@@ a reduced by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with ac@@ las@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the ac@@ last@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment with BM@@ D at all time points .
in comparison to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total hardness and by 4.3 % on the lower lid .
clinical efficacy in men In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , especially light to moderate severe morph@@ ine Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.2 to 3.0 age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in the observation phase .
patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study of 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate at an average duration of the observation period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ eless .
after that the plasma @-@ bar rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 2 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance caused by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely since z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min at 64 studied patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 m@@ l. / min no dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
because there are only limited data for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ arian single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
in dogs studies , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C mean 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point occur .
the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was im@@ printed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a low@@ ly serum @-@ calcium mirror .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is marketed .
risk Management Plan The holder of approval for the placing on the market under@@ takes to undertake the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application of authorisation and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ load@@ a works by restoring bone reconstruction back to normal , ensuring normal bone formation and giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ credited .
when using Ac@@ credited with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used drugs , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you use drugs that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , make sure that you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ credited .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ tu@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after the in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending treatment with Ac@@ load@@ a If you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ credited a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ credited .
at present , it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received Ac@@ credited a .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this user information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to take Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s in@@ fusion two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a , can develop due to the rapid adjustment of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tu@@ a .

A@@ compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more
in addition , there were four studies in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smo@@ kers compared to a placebo .
the studies on the attitudes of smoking , on the other hand , showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a that were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
medicines used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
it is an addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which have one or more risk factors like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ d@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years due to the lack of data about efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts at up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in individual cases exceed the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also common in patients who - apart from obesity - have no apparent risks , can cause depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other approaching individuals may indicate that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al ( carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , car@@ ob herb ) has not been studied , is thought that the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it may additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin was 0.@@ 94 % in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in in cases where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be seen for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced progressive mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be led by the clinical evaluation by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) appeared as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or as a double @-@ dose combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events in random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs , treatment is cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ insulin emia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fo@@ etus growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary variation of the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was more common than placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo res@@ ides .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures in random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative drugs .
over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to act through activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it was shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and improves peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years , in order to investigate the time before stopping the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the treatment a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been in@@ adequately employed despite three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly raised LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas in met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced levels were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level by means of an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations as well as the ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentration of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma generally reaches 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in roughly the thre@@ ef@@ old of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively mark@@ ated pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma curing time of un@@ changeable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ em@@ el@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity associated with the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fo@@ etus growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced at the rat .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ tured frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide , were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has a positive effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women was shown .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed with 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ ke suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another human insulin level .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is included in the package insert ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks involved in treating diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can significantly affect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
every change regarding starch , brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the treatment and always ask his patients after other medicines taken by them .
4 If hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o increases .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and may end with transi@@ ent or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .
neuro@@ logical disorders - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with symptoms which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally reversible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin diseases and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue joints - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise when failed to change the insertion points within the injection unit .
during insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape plays , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety level , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be put up , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger crystalline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damages ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level still exceeds 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year in 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg . patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients , who received 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver compounds .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one of the medical history known or current g@@ out node and / or gi@@ g@@ oste@@ o@@ arthritis ) .
if the serum pole tag is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .

cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic medicines , a acute g@@ out attack can occur during treatment , because it can initially mobili@@ se urine acid deposits in the tissue by lowering the serum pole acid .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - and Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials slight disorders of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ e- and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in zinc was not performed at F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .

in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed gest@@ ures do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate on pregnancy or fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns health .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in carrying out dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ory in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensation heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate and reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical studies no serious ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information on occasion .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Ser@@ um@@ ar acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum total value at the beginning of study &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of serum pole acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanent throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. , h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage recovery of the serum resin concentrations in patients regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( Bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not require any treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ out node size , resulting in a total disappearance of the g@@ out nodes by month 24 in 54 % of patients .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportion@@ ately .
for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after the intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approx . 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage reduction in serum resin concentrations as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma bonding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ated f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate about 49 % of the dose found in the urine as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , about 45 % of the dose found in the stool as unchanged F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cos@@ one of the active agent ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to patients with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ ate increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately 4 times the human@@ oid exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , roughly 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human@@ oid exposure , did not yield ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Ser@@ um@@ ar acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not require any treatment against a g@@ out ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who received exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , ul@@ cer@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) , and acid pushing .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it should not be used in case of diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y can be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ ec@@ tures , were reported in patients receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially they were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that are pointing to potential haz@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and the patients should be advised to susp@@ end the drug in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ icious heart@@ burn or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn . ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions be transmitted to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and associated with complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens mainly administered intraven@@ ously bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether stopping a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician is essential for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their om@@ is@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to the beginning of the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , the intake of the serum cal@@ ci@@ um to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar incidence .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture @-@ intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years were 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction was achieved in comparison with the placebo group ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % vs. placebo 6.3 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the verteb@@ ral column and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ y studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the middle oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in females 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before receiving a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to around 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily spread in soft tissue after the intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted to the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively tagged substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing rate was not 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not thought that in humans it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medications by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , patients with reduced kidney function can expect a somewhat higher accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , comparing the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ ds antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , as the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken simultaneously must be adjusted accordingly .
hard caps , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange jel@@ ly capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule part with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should be undertaken only under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level mirror should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talk level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral intake of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion solutions ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adaptation may be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this change has to take place in proportion to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
after mig@@ rating from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily , the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection has to begin once a day .
in adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other gra@@ ft recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , was used in an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of the serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talk level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with con@@ current use of substances which could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a low @-@ clearance drug , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood cannot exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ cover or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should be undertaken only under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In order to treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical efficacy of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal preparations containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ar skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , show symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
da Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special care is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels while offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us drugs is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduces the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and therefore can increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the imp@@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the con@@ current treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is common in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) .
cases of anti @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal neuro@@ lo@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
the impact mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of Pro@@ gra@@ f administered twice a day according to other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts .
175 l@@ ung@@ ware patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ as transplantation , were used in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies elu@@ ci@@ dated the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was applied to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ entre study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the case of patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % were reported under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ um@@ ed from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplantation was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multic@@ enter study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) procedure or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) procedure .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
color@@ ect@@ al transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplantation demonstrated an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a reinforcement of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through bile .
in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talk level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inj@@ ected that it enables the formation of the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 510 new blood screening periods with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ances should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transfer of adv@@ anc@@ ef@@ in across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II @-@ activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma bar is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to VI@@ II factor , which can be achieved in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the feeding speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to VI@@ II factor , where the risk is most important within the first 20 ex@@ positions and depends on genetic and other factors .
in untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which were present in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed higher risk of inhibit@@ ors in previously untreated patients , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ MS in@@ fusion in post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ AN@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were diagnosed with F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ MS inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were occasionally reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ MS reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ MS were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AN@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AN@@ S &apos;s security profile , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required , so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient presenting the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the sub@@ structure , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers to the questions asked by the company , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the documents submitted initially , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection brings benefits to patients in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activities were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment started and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ins alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , oral dro@@ ught , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) may not be applied .
aer@@ os@@ ins may not be used in patients with hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ asis ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ asis ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Commission to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data concerning the harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be attributed to per@@ oral or nas@@ al ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ sm , oxy@@ sm , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ins were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment should be removed when hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ ache ) must be stopped .
• Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is scheduled for at least 48 hours prior to the execution of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not in@@ hibit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ins during pregnancy is not secured ; experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ test properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , trans@@ verse pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause more symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ins tablets with regard to the decreasing effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ins tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ os@@ ins , it is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the dose in the plasma .
after the peri@@ odic application of aer@@ os@@ ins in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional immun@@ ology studies , for toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and worked before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses during the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • Heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythms • nau@@ sea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
the use of the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aer@@ os@@ ol causes di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should check out your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot the intake of aer@@ os@@ ins , if you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / l ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children between the ages of six and eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ ling , depression of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Commission for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and res@@ um@@ ed during re@@ occurring .
during the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( on@@ set of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been noted in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking ag@@ eri@@ us and alcohol at the same time did not increase the performance reduction of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common side @-@ effects reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect was head@@ ache , with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study of multiple doses , which was administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered over ten days in a dose of 45 mg daily ( that was nine times the clinical dose ) , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the on@@ set of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the on@@ set of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined as a substitute for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also leading to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching growth by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ell@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .

the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that will support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ ze the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which can metaboli@@ se severely , is identical to that of children that metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance reduction of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( ne@@ oplas@@ tic of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed .
at a single @-@ dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not increase drow@@ sin@@ ess or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limiting metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations on children from 2 to 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are severely metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ duration of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were compared to the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III plastic bottles with a safe polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study of multiple doses , which was used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used over ten days in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ o@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the gli@@ ding including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the enam@@ el tablets must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets for the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the som@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not dimin@@ ish significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this bad metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged 2 to 11 ( 6 % ) , and among black ones ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose Cros@@ sover studies of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets have the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years .

the safety of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which may be metaboli@@ zed - is identical to that of children that metaboli@@ se normal .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group , similar to the placebo group .
in infants from 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported as placebo were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution was not observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be dependent on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. acknowledged the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially to withdraw its application for approval for the launch of A@@ bes@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of cavi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus in this family of rapid antibodies .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ par@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination is not investigated .
as@@ par@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus is to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day of 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ par@@ ase after body weight is determined .
as@@ par@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood when combined with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
aids do not cure , but can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
as@@ par@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who formerly used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under as@@ par@@ ase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but as@@ par@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , as@@ par@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were treated to the treatment .
in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ onic avi@@ r increased the viral load following 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of as@@ par@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash , and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 as@@ par@@ ase may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other constitu@@ ents .
as@@ par@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down just like as@@ par@@ ase and are det@@ ri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking as@@ par@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ par@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster Rit@@ onic avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefit of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the transport of as@@ par@@ ase across the European Union .
as@@ par@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually as@@ par@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , as@@ par@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ par@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If as@@ par@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of p@@ inion ( booster ) , higher doses may be applied to as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ par@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ par@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of as@@ par@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ par@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be informed that as@@ par@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ par@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually as@@ par@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased incidence of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ par@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oids , which are metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ par@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , it may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ it@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high rate of propylene gly@@ col due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on of the as@@ par@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ par@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with this .
in ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and can also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width as@@ par@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ onic avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by using herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already familiar with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ on@@ ze mirrors are and , if possible , to check the viral load and to susp@@ end the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
dosage adjustment for one medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ s@@ ules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) was administered twice a day in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase revenues are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , no dose adaptation is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ stick .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , because a precise prog@@ nosis of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ onic avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ par@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies using as@@ par@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
simultaneous use of two times a day 700 mg f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily with no simultaneous use of fossi@@ ls with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with as@@ par@@ ase , may cause interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with as@@ par@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ par@@ ase , as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as an enzyme @-@ induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma cross@@ bars of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous use with as@@ par@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side @-@ effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ oc@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ par@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with this glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oid , unless the possible use of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be expected to increase plasma levels while consuming as@@ par@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ par@@ ase may not be used together with the or@@ ally captured Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while acting with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma bar of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am about 3 to 4 fa@@ des .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , particularly if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ par@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended as well .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of as@@ par@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was administered from the inc@@ ision to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the adoption of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ par@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side @-@ effects associated with the as@@ par@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rup@@ ture .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking as@@ par@@ ase or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events described below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of as@@ par@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes arising under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and potential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients were present in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes usually were mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ par@@ ase twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception was the elevation of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients receiving at@@ ra@@ ase along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in the case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supporting measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral gn@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ases with the consequence of formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the link between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved fossil dynam@@ ometer / Rit@@ onic cavi@@ ties - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of fossi@@ ls with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 4@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based analyses based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing systems can be used to assess the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clinical analyses based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r produces a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ onic avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ ar resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses , not previously untreated patients with a fossil dynam@@ ometer ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , bay avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , bay avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing treatment is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of efficacy of as@@ par@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the trial PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study in which PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ par@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ basement of AP@@ V / Rit@@ onic avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ basement wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of untreated as@@ par@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , as@@ par@@ ase solution was used to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose ra@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ par@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ conditioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x if Rit@@ onic ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentrations in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) were unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ it@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound ampl@@ itude that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ampl@@ itude remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state through the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ par@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the offering of as@@ par@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ atal exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ par@@ ase solution and as@@ par@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
also ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ onic avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day with no simultaneous dosing of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ op@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas showed ben@@ ign ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas during do@@ si@@ fications , which met the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not been elu@@ ci@@ dated yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has yet been observed in clinical studies , either during the administration of as@@ par@@ ase or after treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age 4 showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rats ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage at humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If as@@ par@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of p@@ inion ( booster ) , higher doses may be applied to as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ par@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with weak or minor liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ par@@ ase should be dropped to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ s@@ ules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , because a precise prog@@ nosis of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ onic avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ par@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ it@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ oc@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ par@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was administered from the inc@@ ision to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ par@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ conditioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ampl@@ itude remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ par@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ onic avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas demonstrated in male animals with dos@@ ages that met the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily donation of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not been elu@@ ci@@ dated yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age 4 showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the Met@@ aboli@@ sm path@@ ways are not fully mature in the young , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
as@@ par@@ ase solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ase solution was not covered with previously untreated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , as@@ par@@ ase capsules and solution are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to weight ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ par@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ atal / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ par@@ ase solution for use and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ is solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high rate of propylene gly@@ col , the as@@ par@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be informed that as@@ par@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ par@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ par@@ ase should be stopped in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ onic avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ s@@ ules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use with as@@ par@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as@@ par@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl glut@@ col contained in the pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was administered from the inc@@ ision to the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ par@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking as@@ par@@ ase or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved fossil dynam@@ ometer / Rit@@ onic cavi@@ ties - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a ver@@ sive 60 treatment is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ conditioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , it is prescribed three times a week during one or two four week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream should be dil@@ uted to the affected skin areas , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo applied either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of cases in the genital area , the complete rate of treatment in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with placebo had a complete rate of treatment of 66 % to 80 % in the placebo group treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or the number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has been continued until all visible pe@@ ers have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only partially healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient had to apply the cream once he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and place in the clean@@ sed skin area infected with the cream until the cream is completely absorbed .
these patients should be weighing up between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take a balance between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with one to be circumc@@ ised leading t@@ inc@@ ture .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have resulted in temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous materials used to treat external genital and peri@@ anal tendencies , no clinical experience has been found .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of incidence in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a therapeutic break can be made for several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment is completed .
since no data is available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in case of super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent or pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for previously untreated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ m and hands do not support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy on intensity or go back after replacing the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
out of animal studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one time nor after several topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and as prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application place with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the adverse events reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
the most common adverse side @-@ effect associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ or@@ ation / fl@@ aking ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream very often came to severe Er@@ y@@ themen ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ rot@@ ting and c@@ rank@@ ings ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of all patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine patients completely healed the cow@@ ards ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications Foreign F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages investigated ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses ranging from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months was not similar to the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours in the application area .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for humans is to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .

if it remains untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only with flat ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection .
O If you have used al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations before you begin treatment , please inform your doctor before you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream only when the area to be treated is healed after a previous medical treatment or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a .
in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o Do not use more cream than your doctor ordered you . o Do not expose the treated place after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a band@@ age or plaster . o If reactions occur at the treated place , which will give you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .

if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , fertili@@ zation of the skin or difficulties can be expected when the fores@@ kin is re@@ treated .
apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream not to ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside anus ( anus ) .
taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse during the infection with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not previously ) perform .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
do not breast@@ feed your baby during the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , since it is not known whether i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od occurs in breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in cases of inclin@@ ation , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its efficacy was also measured ( by examining the effect of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be known each year and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ ary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ tious .
60 minutes before the in@@ fusion begins with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical studies were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and in 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed in a period of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing rest and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy duty cycle and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a more severe form of circulation usually within a month compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in which it had never occurred to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was to be determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells absorbed into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity to be treated in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not statisti@@ cally significant over this period and the absolute lung volume is further proportional to the height of the growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG levels in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation of the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint Ah@@ i and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe sequ@@ ential form and 4 with the mean progression form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development velocity for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form there were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk were performed .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage intake with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety level , toxic@@ ity in a unique application , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6 . 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , demonstrated prolonged survival times when administered by A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
every breakthrough bottle has to be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , except for over@@ riding surface epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - and advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , except for over@@ riding surface epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the tel@@ emet@@ ric in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must continue throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created prior to each application , including differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te t@@ ines .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of pre@@ - h@@ ating treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 years of age or above have an increased risk of side effects when compared to patients aged 65 years old .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose modifications recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row de@@ pressed and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ens , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the preceding cycles of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ con@@ junc@@ tival toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was noticed if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 took place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion to the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered .
5 major cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this ingredient was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible pe@@ eling of the reproductive capacity by tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment g@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the sperm reservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g a day ) lead to a decreased P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when using high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ally 2 days after the treatment with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ abolic an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely mandatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the locking of sperm .
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed - and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

a threshold of 5 % was set for this table in relation to the recording of all events in which the report was held in connection with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of the patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed comprised sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 of three P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) , except Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase of the Alan@@ in@@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , which were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who were ran@@ ge@@ - dominated C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ ting and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical studies with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , which is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
clinical studies have reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , intestinal per@@ v@@ ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
in clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure were reported in tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by Thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ an showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients treated only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ an was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy took a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months for patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit from A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ basement level of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking All@@ i and after 12 weeks have no weight loss should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , whereby about a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food un@@ d@@ aut the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stool lab@@ eling , stu@@ cco strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( de@@ composition ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the launch of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Ch@@ ant ( see section 4.6 ) • L@@ lac@@ tation ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich snack or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with an improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with con@@ current application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar was observed .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international standard @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years remained at the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are connected with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were measured from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treating with all@@ i can lead to di@@ lem@@ ma with regard to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects deri@@ ving from the anti @-@ passive properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect l@@ ends in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in remnant of ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , o@@ ily @-@ du@@ ed diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin came with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output value of 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable for 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , to which the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ed dose was administered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ eine concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ ell@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

food di@@ aries are effective , as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
to safely reach your target weight , you should define two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutrition yourself fat in order to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • St@@ ay physically active during intake and also after completion of intake of all@@ i .
• all@@ i may not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use by all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
• You may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not important to change your diet at short notice and return to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule gradually . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without the discharge , sudden or increased chair strand and soft chair ) can be attributed to the active mechanism ( see Section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions will detect you in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , sweat out@@ breaks , ras@@ hes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very common side effects These may occur in more than 1 out of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • B@@ ills ( Flat@@ ul@@ enz ) with and without a full discharge • sudden stu@@ b cord • Smo@@ king or o@@ ily chair • Wei@@ cher chair inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects is ampli@@ fied or you significantly affected .
frequent side effects These may occur in 1 out of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • ga@@ stri@@ c ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( stool ) • wat@@ ery / liquid chair • increased stu@@ ds • Con@@ tri@@ butions check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects is ampli@@ fied or you significantly affected .
it is not known how often these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enzymes • Eff@@ ect on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients taking War@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ dil@@ uting ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet at this time .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional aspects : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms will learn to control them over time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep the medicine for children un@@ accessible . • Do not use any more after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this pack .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and have a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you will also find on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
which@@ ever quantity is suitable for you , please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the probability of nutritional supplements .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you daily work only little or no , stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 calories daily , e.g. by 3 km going , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and also adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional journal with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fat levels and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there are not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ chem@@ y showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , versus 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
al@@ op@@ xi is indicated for preventing acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi in preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given prior to chemotherapy .
because pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely mes@@ hed after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to have such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not supposed to be used for the prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , k@@ ini@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with al@@ oh@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events as in the other dosing groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment with an al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25@@ mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ duration of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given which was given on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy of ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g. of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the im@@ puri@@ ties involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. arranged pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ duration of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after IV dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after a unique intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time charge of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours of urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a unique intraven@@ ous injection injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale elimination of symptoms and the average systemic exposure increase with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a small relevance for clinical use .
10 The prec@@ lin@@ ical studies suggest that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and as Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of approval for the delivery of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reference Medic@@ inal Products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue as@@ signs damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood of the liver are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks and 6 months after the treatment was switched on ( i.e. no sign of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA .
furthermore concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the trial to investigate the question , to what extent the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not act against this type of infections .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the surface to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hibit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ utter@@ ed after the treatment was completed .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients taking placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in the skin wound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ aries , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection begins .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials for secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ot@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of con@@ current use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on poorly tolerated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and fo@@ etus / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ os@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / terminated , the benefits of breast @-@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women should be considered .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common adverse event was irrit@@ ation at the location , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance extracted by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ wort anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Unit and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial p @-@ binding inter@@ activity and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , a consultation with experts should be sought .
no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on scre@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people with topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of scre@@ ened skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The Met@@ aboli@@ sm in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ os@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ h test or in human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro @-@ nucle@@ us for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be terminated in two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contributing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adult and the vaccine approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ Form adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals on behalf of the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardis@@ ation plan for imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refreshing vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are the same as vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a new vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As for all inj@@ ections , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies are achieved after the prim@@ di@@ fication , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the but@@ to@@ cks could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these injection routes should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , since it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ination , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ based vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ lex .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation base per imm@@ uni@@ zation dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ lex .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared with 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ ernity , however , was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , which was administered for month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was measured , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , according to the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received from a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the end of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable for 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was given at the same time by the introduction of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ines , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the Res@@ us@@ pen@@ ding to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state @-@ owned char@@ itable sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been concluded with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Se@@ ek your doctor if you / your child take more medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given or that is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data which has become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the limited patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also be used in pre@@ history for patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
ammon@@ ium is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo medication , that is , no active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impotence , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste sa@@ di@@ version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ammon@@ ia effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was admitted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ fests form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first months of life ) , an indication is for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest defect of car@@ bam@@ boo phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys take place , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in human milk during human breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of those adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ ine dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cor@@ r@@ yo@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred with a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which in intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound formed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early @-@ mani@@ fests form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death even when treated with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life .
through h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fests form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the eth@@ in@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary tract dysfunction or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ates ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected on the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting in the plasma after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no treatment effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who are not able to swal@@ low the tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ or or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest defect of car@@ bam@@ boo phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes before the birth Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) were exposed , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ ine dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cor@@ r@@ yo@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is taken from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen for each gram .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ates may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , ret@@ ali@@ ation of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ b@@ ance and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

31 • Take from the container a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for instance with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stroke &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in the case of sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug aimed at preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment using He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - in the absence of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous induction of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
in case the patient subsequently performs a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI is able to resume the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous pul@@ ses of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bol@@ us dose is administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value lies below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular weight .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n most bleeding of arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle throughout ble@@ ed@@ ings .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n reaches the level existing before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination of bi@@ valent studies with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ ul@@ ators or antibodies , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters can be monitored regularly in any case .
the experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .

an Ac@@ u@@ ity heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reducing hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with a well known bleeding center , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding center , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed loc@@ alized loc@@ ales , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years more frequently came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .

the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system classes in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is to be interrupted immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on t@@ innitus .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in turn slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with serum was not induced to indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the case of a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin cannot be effectively processed .
insulin li@@ s@@ ine is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter working life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body insulin cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in the first six months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lip@@ id .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration decreased by 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ c@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra might have to be adjusted when it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal , th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or to be applied sub@@ cut@@ aneously by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal bu@@ cks .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of the actual intensity , the brand ( Her@@ - steller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosing or abor@@ tion of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme .
among the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , fluor@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tica such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pin the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
the following are listed in clinical trials listed , grouped according to system organ@@ es and ordered according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness can be treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dosage of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the action occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with the normal insulin @-@ insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin concentrations in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ a effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cul@@ ating effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ core effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
it was evident from the data that in an application of insulin lu@@ c@@ sin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if Insul@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ sin was engaged 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine at dosing 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine at the age of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
