<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which the patient manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and in the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied or the melting tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter appears to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which were suffering from increased disturbance over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that were suffering from increased disturbance with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours compared.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in patients "symptoms was examined using a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness compared to the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbance, acathema, somnolence (digesting), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke about the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased disturbance and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">Abilify recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder showed no increased suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accounted and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study of fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydenia, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint offering of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 ininhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in ariboprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical studies showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrooporphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextrooporphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies at the animal, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia was seen in patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olandin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole and 17.6% for those under lithium.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdose with Aripiprazole was observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma penetration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the caudatus nucleus and at the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder's respondents who were referring to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">A placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher return rate for Aripiprazole, 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olandin-controlled multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study potential was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior effect on placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which were partially over 2 weeks not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirroring, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effect in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl compared to placebo in comparison to the prevention of a bipolar residues, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and HydroxyModeling of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination round is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in respect of ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripithelial were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spellology, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-adrenergic toxicity (lipofuscine pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of apes after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulfate-conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazl at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Aripiprazole did not exceed 6% of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 of the mean steadder state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablettes or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed in case of extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accounted and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a disease include high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness, and signs of autonomous instability (irregular heartbeat or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydenia, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazl, in a study where healthy subjects Aripiprazl (15 mg dosage) were used as one-time input intramuscularly and who simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 "poor" (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) were intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole after alluring.</seg>

<seg id="167">In the long-term survival period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to the aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement observed on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe disability, a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the responder's share of response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">A placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher return rate for aripiprazole (oral), which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olandin-controlled multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study potential was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which were partially over 2 weeks not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirroring, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effect in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl compared to placebo in comparison to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, AUC is 90% bigger the AUC after the dose of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was applied for 1 to 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity after IV application no safety-relevant concerns were obtained after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety spellar ology, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects encompassed a dose-dependent non-adrenergic toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle of apes after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 times.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study of 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared to a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">A total of 72 (31%) of the 229 treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in terms of these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should not be applied to patients who are breastfeeding or have low neutrophils in the blood prior to the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other paclitaxel with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the transport of Abraxans across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for the treatment of a standard anthracycline therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neuropenia (neutrophiles &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensorial neuropathy during abrasion, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">With sensory neuropathy degree 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degrees 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="286">In case patients occur after the treatment of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constitial agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to testify during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation prior to the treatment as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect traffic stability and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most eye-catching important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; Leukopenie was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the addition of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in trials (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactine hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, elevated phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphages, flatulence, tongue burns, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thoracic wall, weakness of the musculature, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, abdominal pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules active substance which promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transmits the transzytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel with endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendocorneal transport through the gp-60 aluminous receptor is mediated and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream ted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanimous unobstructed studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement by a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at one time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 In patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft bonding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">Clearing of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel chemotherapy, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that abseamed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood-blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Absecamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections may also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoitin deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is injected, which makes it capable of forming epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medical drug in a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Errypo at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Errypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erapo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were observed in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Errypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Errypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, since further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erro.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abseamed will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co. kg for the transport of abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, abseamed can be applied to adults without iron deficiency in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except pediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and foldings may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can sometimes be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value rises by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely meshed to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and consequential symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely meshed to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticuloyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase has increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reticuloyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Reticuloyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozytenfold increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, is a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should receive abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case epoetin alfa should be present preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the tube of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are diagnosed with erythroblastoenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA), should not receive abseamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the otides or cerebrovascular diseases; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular events.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after monate- until years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, the reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiumption, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hematisis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Reticuloyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Reticuloyte index), is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the application of epoeines if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of anemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin switch should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to these findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients with chemotherapy, epoetin alfa treatment efficiency should be considered for a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients that may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients intended for a larger orthodontic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia prior to the onset of epoetin alfa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger orthodontic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially for underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it is impossible to exclude that epoetin alfa can consist of an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events for patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the coiclosporindose should be adjusted to the increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF on hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoietin treatment, it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically recovered epoetin alfa is glycosilicone and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content associated with the endogenous human erythropoetin isolated from the urine in anemic patients.</seg>

<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen just after Actual application.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see Section 4.4) in Patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents with Acloada are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, since data concerning the harmlessness and effectiveness are missing.</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic was associated with renal dysfunctions, which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum-creatinins) and in rare cases as an acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were present in 2.3% of patients treated with Actua in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with aceta in the disease-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to Actua (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area was commonly reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrosis in the jaw area in a patient treated with aceta and in a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a BMD (BMD) T-score for the femoral neck ≤ -1.5 and at least two light or a medium-heavy existing vertebral fracture or a BMD-T score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric curves aclasa lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebrate fractures (see table 2).</seg>

<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures aclasa showed a consistent effect over three years that resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thigh neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aceta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic crest.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone tissue markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Acloada reduced by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with aclasa compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the HORIZON-RFT study increased the aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment with BMD at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total hardness and by 4.3% on the lower lid.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% for men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically proven, especially light to moderate severe morphine Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.2 to 3.0 age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of oledronic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronate after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in the observation phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Patients who participated in the follow-up study of 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with risedronate, compared with 71 patients treated with risedronate at an average duration of the observation period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of oledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosiseless.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma-bar rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminale Elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 2 ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the prescribed dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance caused by Cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely since zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min at 64 studied patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml. / min no dose adaptation of the zoledronic acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only limited data for severe renal dysfunction (Creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letarian single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs studies, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC mean 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds) well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions, which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and the intravenous injection point occur.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats one observed teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was imprinted at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a lowly serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the present dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl resin was 0.94% in HbA1c, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin, showed a reduction in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin in cases where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry the marking" "" "15" "" "on one side and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be seen for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced progressive macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of the liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be led by the clinical evaluation by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) appeared as a result of a hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral double or triple-combination therapy with a sulphonyl resin or as a double-dose combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindices, including pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events in randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The fractured fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs, treatment is cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone, hyperinsulin emia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary variation of the turgor and the index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege was more common than placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe congestive heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone or placebo resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures in randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative drugs.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing ProActive study, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to act through activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucosal production in the liver and improves peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years, in order to investigate the time before stopping the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the treatment a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been inadequately employed despite three months of optimization with insulin were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slight, but clinically not significantly raised LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide, and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, whereas in metformin and gliclacide reduced levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the triglyceride level by means of an effect on triglyceride concentrations as well as the epatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentration of unchanging pioglitazone in plasma generally reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in roughly the threefold of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively markated pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the feces (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma curing time of unchangeable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearances of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, plasma volume enlargement with haemelution, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophie occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulin sensitivity associated with the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for foetus growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced at the rat.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) treatment with two other thiazolidindices led to increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fractured fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive trial, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with pioglitazone or gliclacide, were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the triglyceride level, which has a positive effect on Tryglyceride and hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal of its primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated with the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape plays, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Heavy hypoglycemia associated with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose which is given intravenously by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption Profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A series of fission (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety level, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1190">Theophyllin zinc was not performed at Febuxostat, but it is known that XO-inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline level (an inhibition of the metabolism of theophyllin was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">The simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in Febuxostature exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dosage adjustment for febuxostat or the simultaneously used other active ingredient is required.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostate to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed gestures do not include side effects of febuxostate on pregnancy or fetus / newborns health.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in carrying out dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatory in the pivotal study phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal correlation with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an atherosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensation heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse events that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostate and reported in all Febuxostate treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin. * * In the clinical studies no serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term renewal studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the information on occasion.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypaesthesia, eye-catching ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin lesions, lesitis, proteinuria, kidney failure, erectile dysfunction, increase in the blood concentration in the blood, decline of the lymphocyte, decrease the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Serumar acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily compared with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily compared with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The lowering of serum pole acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanent throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (i.e., h).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage recovery of the serum resin concentrations in patients regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study (Baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout seizures, so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not require any treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gout node size, resulting in a total disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24 in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionately.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For Febuxostat doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AUC is observed, which is greater than the dosisproportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After the intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to approx. 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage reduction in serum resin concentrations as long as this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma bonding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>

<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were approximately 4 times the humanoid exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which was accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) compared to those who received exclusively Alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcer (ulceration), ulcer (ulceration), ulcerated abdomen (bloated abdomen), and acid pushing.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions be transmitted to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and associated with complications, were rarely reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1402">As Tacrolimus and Prograft / Prograft are already in use in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft and data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, comparing the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment period of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be careful when other (especially some herbal) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Advagraf, as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the medication taken simultaneously must be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or regime should be undertaken only under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level measurements (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus level mirror should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a talent level, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus talk level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adaptation of the Advagraf can take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition does not allow oral intake of medicines in the first postoperative period, the Tacrolimus treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of infusion solutions) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application In order to suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of the graft rejection The orale Advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adaptation may be required later as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the graft rejection The orale Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this change has to take place in proportion to 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After migrating from other immunosuppressiva to Advagraf once daily, the treatment with the recommended oral initialdose for the prophylaxis of the graft rejection has to begin once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1426">In adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other graft recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, was used in an oral initiation dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in case of pankreastransplantation patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups Patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including regular determination of the serum levels of serum, a calculation of the creatine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advised caution (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood-tacrolimus-tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus talk level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level of tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or with concurrent use of substances which could alter the Tacrolimus blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a low-clearance drug, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood cannot exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus undercover or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or regime should be undertaken only under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective compared to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of the graft rejection in adult heart transplants and graft recipients in childhood, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus blood and a weakening of the clinical efficacy of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal preparations containing currant (hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolius concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a hypertrophie referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligar skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, show symptoms for PRES like headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels while offering substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other Tacrolimus drugs is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus reduces the clearance of steroid contraceptives and therefore can increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of anti-virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal neuroloencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The impact mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus by binding to a cytosole protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to calciumdependent inhibition of signalling pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a specific number of lymphoma genes.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lungware patients, in 475 patients undergoing pancreas transplantation, were used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as the primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies elucidated the observations in the large studies in which prograf was applied to primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multicentre study of oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to receive either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">A chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome, was less common in the first year after the transplant (2,86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimuscle and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the case of patients treated with Tacrolimus, in 21,7% of cases, bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% were reported under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enumed from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplantation was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study of oral prograf was performed in 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised Tacrolimus (n = 103) procedure or Ciclosporin (n = 102) procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral Initialdose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as the primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation demonstrated an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist, Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to descent between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recent graft radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a reinforcement of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) relative to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus talk level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is injected that it enables the formation of the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advate in the prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510 new blood screening periods with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances should not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the transfer of advancefin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following haemorrhagic events the factor VIII-activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma bar is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to VIII factor, which can be achieved in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the hemorrhage is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The feeding speed should be based on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to VIII factor, where the risk is most important within the first 20 expositions and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In untreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and amnestically known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which were present in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), which showed higher risk of inhibitors in previously untreated patients, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels occurred in a patient under continuous ADVMS infusion in postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day).</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitortiter after 26 expositions with ADVANATE (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were diagnosed with FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of a current clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVMS inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were occasionally reported on the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and increased number of eosinophilous granulocytes in several repeated product expositions as part of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVANS's security profile, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months required, so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to withdraw its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient presenting the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the substructure, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers to the questions asked by the company, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the documents submitted initially, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin injection brings benefits to patients in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main activities were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment started and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients with Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took the loratadins alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), oral drought, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">In patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosins may not be used in patients with hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hypertension), hyperthyroiasis (hypertension) or hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiasis (hypertension) or hypertension (hypertension caused by cerebral thrombosis).</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Commission to transport Aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data concerning the harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with disloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Ergotamin, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be attributed to peroral or nasal (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxysm, oxysm, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosins were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment should be removed when hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">• Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is scheduled for at least 48 hours prior to the execution of dermatological tests, since antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with disloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the disloratadine and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosins during pregnancy is not secured; experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictest properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a dizziness which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated Miktion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transverse pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosins tablets with regard to the decreasing effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with disloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerosins tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerosins, it is detectable within 30 minutes of the dose in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the periodic application of aerosins in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure to an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional immunology studies, for toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadine cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed were generally related to pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies, the combination of Loratadine / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation, the pharmacovigilance system is established and worked before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses during the use of aerosaze: • hypertension • Heart chase, heart palpitations • heart rhythms • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The use of the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aerosol causes dizziness or reduces attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadine very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, insomnia with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous hepatic values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg / l lyophilis (soluble tablets), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between the ages of six and eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the paddling, depression of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Commission for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed during reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During the persisting allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions have not been noted in clinical studies with Desloratadine tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking agerius and alcohol at the same time did not increase the performance reduction of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side-effects reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth-dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side-effect was headache, with 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, with up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-time clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study of multiple doses, which was administered in the desloratadine over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which Desloratadine was administered over ten days in a dose of 45 mg daily (that was nine times the clinical dose), there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and reddening of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined as a substitute for further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causal factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, disloratadine is also leading to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching growth by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of disloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after daily use of disloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with disloratadine at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadine and Loratadine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety spellology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadine cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromatism, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromatism, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that there are no data that will support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolize the loratadine and experience a higher substance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which can metabolise severely, is identical to that of children that metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose-absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance reduction of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. acknowledged the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially to withdraw its application for approval for the launch of Abesunov for the prevention of caviar H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus is emerging, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "" "body foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus in this family of rapid antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, asparase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir as the safety of this combination is not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asparase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus is to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice a day of 100 mg of ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asparase after body weight is determined.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asparase decreases the HIV-quantity in the blood when combined with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids do not cure, but can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asparase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This enhanced drug Agenerase was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who formerly used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under asparase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but asparase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, asparase also reduced viral load, but only very few of the children who previously treated with protease inhibitors were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the treatment with Ritonic avir increased the viral load following 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of asparase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash, and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>

<seg id="1920">Asparase may not be used in patients, the currant (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down just like asparase and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking asparase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecrosis (dying of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asparase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic booster Ritonic avir, but the committee concluded that the benefit of asparase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>

<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approval for the transport of asparase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asparase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually asparase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster by Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonic avir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, asparase capsules and solution are not replaceable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for asparase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asparase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of pinion (booster), higher doses may be applied to asparase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for asparase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asparase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asparase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of asparase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asparase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be informed that asparase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asparase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually asparase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis indicate increased incidence of liver dysfunction in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of asparase and ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocortioids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids, including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asparase with lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, it may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of amprenitr (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high rate of propylene glycol due to the high propylene glycolon of the asparase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under a age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asparase should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and can also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width asparase with ritonavir must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized above CYP2D6 and associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonic avir, adverse effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be humiliated by using herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already familiar with Johanniskraut, the amonze mirrors are and, if possible, to check the viral load and to suspend the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one medicine is not required if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% when Ritonic avir (100 mg twice a day) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice a day) was administered twice a day in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacokinetic study on the use of asparase in combination with Didanosin, but it is recommended that Didanosin and Agenerase revenues are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonic avir (100 mg twice a day), no dose adaptation is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, be careful because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmstick.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be performed, because a precise prognosis of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonic avir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to a rise in side-effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with asparase, the dosage of rifabutin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies using asparase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of two times a day 700 mg fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily with no simultaneous use of fossils with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can, if used together with asparase, may cause interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with asparase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as asparase, as it may result in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as an enzyme-inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma crossbars of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, riodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine and verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with asparase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side-effects with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days, the fluoroconpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of asparase with ritonavir is not recommended along with this glucocortioid, unless the possible use of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, can be expected to increase plasma levels while consuming asparase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased by amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asparase may not be used together with the orally captured Midazolam (see section 4.3) while acting with parenteral midazolam with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma bar of Midazolam about 3 to 4 fades.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for oppiate symptoms, particularly if there are also low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the dose of amprenavirus if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asparase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended as well.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of asparase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in milk lactose-related rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to human milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">During the lactation period, a reproduction study of pregnant rats, to which Amprenavir was administered from the incision to the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the adoption of Amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asparase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-effects associated with the asparase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment abrupture.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking asparase or another medicine used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events described below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of asparase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes arising under the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and potential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTI- pretreated patients were present in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes usually were mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrosis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of asparase twice a day together with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice a day), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; one exception was the elevation of triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients receiving atraase along with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gnag- and gag-pol- polyproteinases with the consequence of formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% HemmConcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is located in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral untreated patients with the currently approved fossil dynamometer / Ritonic cavities - as with other ritonavir treatment regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral non-pretreated patients who received 700mg of fossils with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I41V, V77I, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based analyses based on genotypic resistance testing systems can be used to assess the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonic avir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonic avir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonic avir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M with a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinical analyses based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to assess the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonic avir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonic avir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with a decreased sensitivity to Amprenavir produces a certain cross-resistance against Ritonic avir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenar resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviruses, not previously untreated patients with a fossil dynamometer (one of 25 isolates), bay avir / Ritonic avir (three out of 25 isolates), bay avir / Ritonic avir (three out of 24 insulates), saquinavir / Ritonic avir (three out of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / Ritonic avir (four out of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing treatment is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mutations which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of asparase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the trial PRO30017, a randomized open study in which PI pretreated adults after virological failure (100mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, primarily with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asparase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-basement of APV / Ritonic avir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-basement wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of untreated asparase is based on two uncontrolled trials of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, asparase solution was used to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose raritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with asparase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data, the benefits of" "" "unconditioned" "" "asparase should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx if Ritonic (100 mg twice a day) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentrations in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) were unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume and an unhindered penetration of amprenitr from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amplitude that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amplitude remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady state through the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with asparase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The offering of asparase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenatal exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, asparase solution and asparase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also renal clearing of Ritonic avir is negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction on the elimination of Amprenavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day with no simultaneous dosing of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with Amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatopellular adenomas showed benign epatocellular adenomas during dosifications, which met the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinoma has not been elucidated yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test of rats and chromosome aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>

<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod Cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), excloration / flaking (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times a weekly treatment with Imiquimod Cream very often came to severe Erythemen (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scrotting and crankings (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cowards in an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of all patients who were treated with Imiquimodine patients completely healed the cowards; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of imiquimod with five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernatural basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertropic, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications Foreign Feignices, actin Keratose and Superartificial basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the dosages investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod Cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin Keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable with healthy adults and adults with actin Keratose or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rat doses ranging from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study carried out for four months was not similar to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in dermal administration on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low system absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for humans is to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumours performed in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects may adversely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignices (condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) have formed superficially basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should be applied only with flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Creme supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, fertilization of the skin or difficulties can be expected when the foreskin is retreated.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Apply Aldara cream not to urethra (urethra), vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or inside anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not previously) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during the treatment with Aldara cream, since it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in cases of inclination, basal cell carcinoma and actin Keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the cowards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see paragraph 2) What do you need to consider before applying aldara cream? ").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">6 weeks a week each week a sufficient amount of aldara cream will be applied to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side effects (expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients) Selected side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 1,000 patients) Very rare side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmacist right away if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause that a blue stain occurs faster or she can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may experience itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually it is lighter skin reactions, which sound again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application place (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application place (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretory, tenderness, swelling or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogging or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, throat, face swelling, ulcers, limbs, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">Following not neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its efficacy was also measured (by examining the effect of reducing GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive to laronidase or any of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may be known each year and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to Genzyme Europe B.V. to transport Aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Chinese hamster ovary).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalizing devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the infusion begins with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration up to 4 years) and in 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed in a period of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing rest and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavy duty cycle and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months after the start of the treatment, with a more severe form of circulation usually within a month compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older.</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients, in which it had never occurred to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG spike in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG in urine was to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells absorbed into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is not statistically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume is further proportional to the height of the growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decrease in the GAG levels in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation of the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint Ahi and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An open phase 2 study was conducted in which Aldurazyme's safety and pharmacokinetics were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe sequential form and 4 with the mean progression form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to elevated Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) showed a normal mental development velocity for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe expiration form there were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk were performed.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 e / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage intake with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety level, toxicity in a unique application, toxicity in repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2336">Since no tolerance studies have been carried out, this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6. 6.</seg>

<seg id="2341">This register will include long-term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Aldurazyme as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2342">In patients suffering from MPS I, an enzyme called α -L-Iduronidase, which splits certain substances in the body (glycosaminoglycans), is missing either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to one of the ingredients of Aldurazyme or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2344">An infusion reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4 "Which side effects are possible").</seg>
<seg id="2345">When using Aldurazyme with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you use drugs containing chloroquin or procaine, because a possible risk of a reduced effect of Aldurazyme exists.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, including non-prescription drugs.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as a therapy for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids should be given before or after the application of cisplatin (to prevent a lack of fluids).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetrexed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural amelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy compared to the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months for the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, demonstrated prolonged survival times when administered by Alimta than with the comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every breakthrough bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cell carcinoma, except for overriding surface epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo- and advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cell carcinoma, except for overriding surface epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as an intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the telemetric infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid can be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must continue throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first telemetrexed dose and after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a complete hemorrhage should be created prior to each application, including differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte tines.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood-picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of pre- hating treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 years of age or above have an increased risk of side effects when compared to patients aged 65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with a creatinin clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose modifications recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not adequate; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-times of the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marrow depressed and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophene has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cyte number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophens, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in the preceding cycles of treatment (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 haematological and non-conjunctival toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was noticed if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 took place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactic measure for reducing treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the treatment with telemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treatment with telemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with telemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion to the telemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with telemetrexed occasionally when this ingredient was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible peeling of the reproductive capacity by telemetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment ginn to obtain advice regarding the sperm reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1,3 g a day) lead to a decreased Pemetrexed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when using high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and minimally 2 days after the treatment with telemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with telemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetric xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with anabolic antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely mandatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by telemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the locking of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed - and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking thymidylatsynthase (DHFR) and glycamidribonucleotid myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis by Thymid- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-center, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin for chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural amelian showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients treated only with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>

<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low-calorie, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who are taking Alli and after 12 weeks have no weight loss should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can not break down some fats in the food, whereby about a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food undaut the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with stool labeling, stucco strand, oily / oily chair, outlet oily secretion (decomposition), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be applied to patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or on cholesterol (liver disease), and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approval for the launch of orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimal resorption, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chant (see section 4.6) • Llactation (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich snack or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with an improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant-contraceptive measures in order to prevent the oral contraception possible in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with concurrent application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the iclosporin plasma bar was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international standard-ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years remained at the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotins in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a one-off dose of Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who simultaneously received orlistat a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are connected with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were measured from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects identified after the launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treating with alli can lead to dilemma with regard to potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side-effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects deriving from the anti-passive properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lends in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin remnant of gastran and pankreatic lipasa.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg orlistat is taken three times a day, which blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, oily-dued diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin came with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (output value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat was 60 mg (starting value of 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (output value of 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable for 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients, to which the minimal systemic resorbied dose was administered, two main metabolites namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-form-leucine group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasmaceine concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety spellology, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment, as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimise nutritional aspects: • Begin already a few days, or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main court or a substantial dessert, as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction. • Most people with those accompanying symptoms will learn to control them over time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep the medicine for children unaccessible. • Do not use any more after the expiration date indicated on the box. • Keep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you will also find on food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the below tables below. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Whichever quantity is suitable for you, please refer to the information below, which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you. • Due to the mode of action of the capsule, compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By complying with the recommended fat intake, you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the probability of nutritional supplements.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low Physical Activity" means that you daily work only little or no, stairs, work in the garden or do other physical activities. • "Medium Physical Activity" means that you can burn 150 calories daily, e.g. by 3 km going, 30- to 45-minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and also adhere to them. • Sense is a nutritional journal with information about the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there are not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with alopxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the 24 hours after chemotherapy, 81% of patients treated with alchemy showed no vomiting (153 from 189), versus 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the transport of Aloxi across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alopxi is indicated for preventing acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroid given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely meshed after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the simultaneous dispensation of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to have such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not supposed to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (ammiodarone, celecoxib, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, kinidine, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 mcg. were reported (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly were associated with alohxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of undesirable events as in the other dosing groups showed themselves; there were no dose-action relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective treatment with an alopia overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of Dolasetron (half-duration of 7.3 hours) were given which was given on Day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy of ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 mcg. of palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the impurities involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.v. arranged palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-duration of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV dose of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) measured mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after a unique intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time charge of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser degree, the isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours of urine, palonosetron as unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous injection injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale elimination of symptoms and the average systemic exposure increase with palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 The preclinical studies suggest that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and as Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the approval of approval for the delivery of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "Reference Medicinal Products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue assigns damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme alanine amino ransferase (ALT) in the blood of the liver are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks and 6 months after the treatment was switched on (i.e. no sign of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the trial to investigate the question, to what extent the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection that is associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not act against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the surface to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cluttered after the treatment was completed.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients taking placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in the skin wound, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmaries, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin ointment the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection begins.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known or suspected as pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials for secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinotulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of concurrent use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment on poorly tolerated skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and foetus / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin saline should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinosulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Altargo continues / terminated, the benefits of breast-feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, the most common adverse event was irritation at the location, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance extracted by fermentation from Clitopilus passwort anus (formerly Purotus passwort anus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding Unit and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptidyltransfer, block partial p-binding interactivity and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin in at least some types of infection appears questionable, a consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on screened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% reapamulin saline twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people with topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of screened skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinosulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low in CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymph test or in human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats micro-nucleus for in-vivo analysis chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times estimated human exposure (see above)), development oxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the application of authorisation (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market commits himself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a Gazproar unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be terminated in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines act by" "" "contributing" "" "to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twinrix adult and the vaccine approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinet adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinForm adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to six and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals on behalf of the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for immunization with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refreshing vaccination is desired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are the same as vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, need a new vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections, an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies are achieved after the primdification, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the buttocks could lead to a suboptimal result, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccination, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that was conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomersal- and preservative-based vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerance of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination simplex.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation base per immunization dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3-dose combination simplex.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had reported pain, compared with 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of maternity, however, was comparable to each proband (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, which was administered for month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was measured, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6, according to the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received from a clinical comparative study at 1-11-year-olds one month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable for 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year was given at the same time by the introduction of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccines, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the Resuspending to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been concluded with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines Ambirix is (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2782">• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itchy rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe blood clotting disorders under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's body, or if you / your child undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Seek your doctor if you / your child take more medicine (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated or immunoglobuline (antibodies) have been given or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to vaccinate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 leased cans): • pain or discomfort at the insertion site or redness • Maternity • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ only (up to 1 case per 10 perimed cans): • swelling at the injection point • Fight (over 38 ° C) • Addiction • Gastro-intestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, which were reported very rarely, days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 perimed cans), are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or expanded rashes that may itch or vesicle, swelling of the eye area and the face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data which has become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the limited patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammontaps can also be used in prehistory for patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammontaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo medication, that is, no active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste sadiversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, ammonia effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammontaps was admitted under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifests form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life), an indication is for the use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest defect of carbamboo phosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenyl butyrate via the liver and kidneys take place, AMMONAPS should be applied only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in human milk during human breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of those adverse events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactine dose, severe hypokalemia, corryotopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred with a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which in intravenous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound formed by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifests form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartal (but within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifests form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ethinintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary tract dysfunction or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrates (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) could not be detected on the next morning after nightly fasting in the plasma after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no treatment effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who are not able to swallow the tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomior or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest defect of carbamboo phosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes before the birth Phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) were exposed, it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactine dose, severe hypokalemia, corryotopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is taken from 0.12 to 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenyl butyrates may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS, as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disorders, retaliation of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbance and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the box and the container after the specified expiry date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS look and contents of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval shape, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>

<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on the same single doses or via a gastric fistel (hose that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall) or a nasal probe (hose that is guided through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon Granules. • Strange a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the top of the knife to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to heart), for instance with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stroke" (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in the case of sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug aimed at preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment using Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - in the absence of new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other miludine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as for people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous induction of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">In case the patient subsequently performs a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI is able to resume the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous pulses of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bolus dose is administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value lies below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular weight.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a malfunctioning of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin most bleeding of arterial puncture points occur, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment in principle throughout bleedings.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of INR-Werts (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bivalirudin reaches the level existing before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocyte aggregate), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalent studies with thrombocyte agulators or antibodies, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxenin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe hemorrhages were defined according to the Acuity and Timi scales for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less under Bivalirudin than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reducing hemoglobin levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with a well known bleeding center, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding center, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed localized locales, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" spots, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study of bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose, treatment with bivalirudin is to be interrupted immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as the anion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on tinnitus.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin in turn slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum was not induced to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the case of a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the Acuity study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin cannot be effectively processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lisine is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter working life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in the first six months compared to 0.14% in insulin lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration decreased by 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lucsin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra might have to be adjusted when it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal, thigh or delta muscle or to be applied subcutaneously by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal bucks.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the actual intensity, the brand (Her- steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosing or abortion of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia are oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, fluoroxifyllin, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, salizylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytica such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpin the symptoms of the adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed in clinical trials listed, grouped according to system organes and ordered according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive hun- ger, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit, can subsequently perform a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia associated with unconsciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous dosage of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluing injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the action occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with the normal insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin concentrations in the therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glucosa effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in the glucosesculating effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lucine has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosescore effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was evident from the data that in an application of insulin lucsin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If Insulinglulisin was engaged 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lucsin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control like with human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucine at dosing 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lucine at the age of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
