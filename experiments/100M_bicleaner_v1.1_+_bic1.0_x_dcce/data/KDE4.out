package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting Exten@@ sions .... Open the Cart@@ es@@ Card Tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de p@@ add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crash . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the module p@@ age@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ ware , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of visu@@ al@@ ising ne@@ sted folders hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; it reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily identified , can be easily recognized if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rec@@ tangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful ink and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is at all displayed , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les should be used ( whereby therefore display errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ tangle .
with rendering algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this objective is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to make the ne@@ sting of entries no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rec@@ tangle is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation remains up to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and preventing space losses through boxes to divide rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can design@@ ate the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small testing application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras View picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you access the module image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set up the image of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
the File Name box of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
by displaying the image size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails is shown in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ alogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders will be included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the File Sel@@ ection in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be stored .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a script , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original pictures with the original pictures to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
use the comment box in the box to specify a comment file for the description of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the Module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to general &amp; HTML ; Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and take your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you to answer other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site to see news about released versions and other information on &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ Buy ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use you as an al@@ b library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; endur@@ es recur@@ sively to the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have any pictures as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My C@@ riteri@@ a to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw @-@ mode of your camera , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly b@@ ypass it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported rough cameras in the Help Roh@@ Camera Support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and take your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , further distributed software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and carries out the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may possibly be unable or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ kam , is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag@@ ging and dropping images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tag , above the horizontal dividing line or another application window . the only restriction is that you can &apos;t put a picture into words , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . in this way , the filter works on the file name only if this ind is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Setup dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . just select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to right @-@ click on the album and select album properties from the pop @-@ up menu .
album collections : are a method of marking your albums so that you can be grouped together under a common name . the collection you choose will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete collections from the toolbar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the el@@ dest , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date to the oldest , newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ mode , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Key@@ word List at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ ver buttons in the toolbar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a short while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by re@@ generating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can change settings . choose the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction section in the main window displays such help window .
pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can view all the functions that are edited with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . You can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... selecting . in the Edit section you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the image processing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening .
you should note that after editing other image editing programs , you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want a photo of &amp; digi@@ kam , delete it , it is moved to the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; moved F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the calendar to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as one keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ ding quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or on an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu will appear that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by selecting it with the right mouse button and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to be able to use keywords , you must first tag your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ ding ; alternatively , you can click on the thumb@@ nails and select keyword from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have attached a photo with keywords , this will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu will display only the keywords associated with the photo .
the time beam view shows a tim@@ e@@ ally adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you just have to click on the bottom rec@@ tangle of the box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search is found . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can search this search here as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and search is done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection again , you only need to select the appropriate entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select an advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed clock@@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / delete search group or deleted from it . each option can be combined with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can create searching of type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ TH@@ ING .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sign@@ atures . the less the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand ink sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ file .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; establishes a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em icon from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ mode ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Tools .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select a preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or deportation operations on one of the pictures , then you will compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use p@@ airing mode from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Pre@@ view mode , both images will show the same image area .
zoom in as well as in other views . just use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when previ@@ ewing in mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos recei@@ veth , scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this , however , not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , delete , convert , group , secure , evaluate , listen , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . according to your definition , metadata is data that can provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use no inventory management to find a particular photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use definitely not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work processes , constant import of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data is written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? add &amp; digi@@ kam ; you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now starts the real work , since you now have to assign keywords , labels and an app@@ rais@@ al to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . it makes sense as you can focus on the best photos when working .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you might even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures . K@@ DE even exports you a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is moving already with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through pictures with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ ies the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all amended versions , thus also for works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples of this can be title like : employee , freelance photographer or independ@@ ant commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for private individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : record errors , disk failure , current bre@@ aches , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , proliferation ab@@ err@@ ations
of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes a loss of data .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may not trust you for more than a few years . of course you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect itself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum . despite this massive protection , they age them through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs is also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good recording device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ex@@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data back to check you . likewise , you should store the media with a description , date &amp; author and store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk fault study
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you operate at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT may not detect these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical equipment doesn &apos;t matter much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause frozen ke@@ yp@@ ads , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and stores the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains surge protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should be aware that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that also all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage protective devices , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with current disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst part is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have to open a photo one day and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in the case of not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of disks .
suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash struck you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup is panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file , retained IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume you have set the scal@@ ability with you and want to increase the area you want to expand on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record is recognized by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ O ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ h@@ 1 # change the size of the rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency .
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open format format designed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use Canon and Nikon &apos;s competitors at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe &apos;s XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms , which allows users to embed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve widespread adoption of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera map , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , then you should add the metadata again . they may be cut off from other programs .
protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to Web@@ Gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. are displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars Properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these pictures have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you use the All File or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed , such as normal folders .
after selecting the target album , press OK and &amp; digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting All Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete a few , you must select them first and delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check whether the photos were uploaded into a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed version before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate file names if you load photos from different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based subtitles . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two will affect the information about the author in the section standard car identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % -@@ % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case , or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed under the name shown by the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of the shooting to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turning is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , lets &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic turning , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , can &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically upload sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case save &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button to select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button Download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , check &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that is indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; user who wants to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map reference . the question is actually more about how the data enters these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last via manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR@@ Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ or or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als comfortably created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .

&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or Start Image Processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright information . these data are automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s profession . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. stell@@ ar photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since this is the image of others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata also has other programs and can be added to &amp; digi@@ kam ; without going to be lost .
save image labels as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this way your labels can also be read from other image viewers . attention : for images that already contain cap@@ tions , they are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ kam .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the lumin@@ aire these settings are turned on . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should use only fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn off the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm is loss@@ less .
with the setting of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning process .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is evolving very quickly into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default image is that all green pixels are equal . if the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , you eliminate this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , which is based on a white card which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in the top lights in four steps . this option is ignored for other cameras .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as penet@@ rating white . use the setting to lo@@ osen sweeping white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the highlights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as quick satur@@ ate as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the part raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ization Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction since you are performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es When an image is opened in the image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Create this folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; investigate these folders during startup .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures do not color the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ rap@@ ie G@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your picture would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print a picture , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . hence , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the Image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Set@@ ting Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn on the metadata that appears at the lower end of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left are a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Rec@@ ogni@@ tion , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used when you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button changes .
you can also see &amp; digi@@ kam the display of the welcome screen ; when starting , it may accelerate the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting Swi@@ m Start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , you asked if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or using the context menu of the preview and selection of the It@@ em View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with Save As File .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File menu or using the button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing restore in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore Edit by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl , -@@ Z to undo and c@@ trl @-@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ construct .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the score menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in toolbar : magni@@ fying factor automatically select
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can edit the toolbar . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Wizard from the Album menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation arrows , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the Text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ hap@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should follow these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field , following the scheme in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword &apos;s IP@@ TC field .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please refer to the keyword Filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually the left side@@ bar with their album , - Date , keyword and search is used . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords in the main view . if the keyword exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog will appear which asks you whether you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images , and then a keyword from the right keyword will be drag@@ ged to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in Settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have a rule and have created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can select an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable der@@ og@@ ation of the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colours you print or publish in the web that correspond to those of your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use a different color space and make thoughts about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you must calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor is installed on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the s@@ RGB color space then you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a fitting monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , S@@ ame , Automatic S@@ ame and Con@@ tr@@ ast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values across the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test dot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a Mag@@ i correction for images that are dark or washed .
compar@@ isons : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous actu@@ ator of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also only produces tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border shades and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge Con@@ tr@@ ast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re@@ ji@@ ze of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted as you work over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjusting lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Ret@@ ur@@ ns buttons make exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set you can save in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button again res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you store this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , calcul@@ us time and is available only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Col@@ ors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ion@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure of a short flash beam and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be generated on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by giving a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strong saturated colours are too much for a few photographers , especially those who hardly de@@ compose landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under Col@@ ors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the slide for the application here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , an active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controllers : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ ching can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources , and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . in this case , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding pixels .
on the preview of the original photo is a red marker . if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposure pixels . if in more than one channel , the combined result is displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ kam ; editing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness , even if you also use the option Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , as the channel mixer is then the tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer setting allows you to save for later and then load it . the used file format is the gi@@ mb@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the option to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film role profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green len@@ tic@@ ular filter . this looks good , with all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red len@@ tic@@ ular filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ mac@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth resp@@ . three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame can be added a decorative box to add an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ing effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percentage . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this can also be done at several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool to apply template you can place a template using an image .
the menu Image St@@ en@@ cil apply in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your templates to &amp; digi@@ kam ; email list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your templates folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to zoom the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but it generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image shar@@ per look . indeed , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ os@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the digi@@ tization process needs to be summar@@ ised with minimal differences at a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG images , a camera is often used in internal sharpen@@ ing . however , pictures in the rough @-@ format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a depth of field while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to go to Cor@@ rec@@ t Archi@@ ves using the menu entry .
you should deal carefully with this , because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is to re@@ focus the tool .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tness with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing Schlei@@ er from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the preview window will help you to edit the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , rough edges and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades can create close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should preferably shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount determines the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this will cause the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example for the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ red mask .
the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Viennese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even strongly influenced by the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ red gauge is authentic . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleas@@ urable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens .
for more information on the error correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the range that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color tin@@ ts allow an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . whereas larger values mostly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and make details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a film grain or a CCD wheel will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , place this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run time . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never exceed 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you get by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend that you om@@ it it .
the Save as and Lo@@ cking buttons make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensory noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically thicker , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur on the edges . it can remove the noise spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local f@@ laws that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
reduce JPEG photos : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ cking buttons make exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and this corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool hot@@ pixel allows to remove hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera close to eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel tags ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filtering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposure corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , the vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise in@@ sensitivity effects occur due to movement .
it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter with the large expos@@ ures area of today &apos;s film and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers . the tool of Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applies the transformation with a center filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright .
with three controls you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor filter and three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly to a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase density by a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tions applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ der covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth density correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general , this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . negative values can be corrected in t@@ onal distor@@ tions and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth density . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ ets the image size and thus causes a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks .
light : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best perform this correction at first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a sound @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the cro@@ pping tool in the menu Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping from image editing or using the Zoom slider on this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as images from the front , frame and picture , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the sound @-@ like correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is accessible from this URL . the filter reproduced the known pol@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the option Add film grain if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of movies , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ dient effect applied to a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth the smooth@@ ness or , seen from the other side , the focus .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out . this would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon labelling filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving im@@ prints your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give back your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter utili@@ zes the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the picture into cells and make it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Dis@@ shar@@ pen : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera .
blur@@ red blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by random@@ ly displacement of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the font in the image and wi@@ pe it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing to keep an area free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ers Dre@@ w or Transform@@ ers mirr@@ oring .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you blow an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform size change in menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Ret@@ ur@@ ns buttons are used exactly . any st@@ all@@ ying for photo magni@@ fying can be saved as text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see an example of photo bubbles at the bottom by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear enlargement magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cro@@ pping of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compose a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ tangle , you will see this rec@@ tangle when you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle can be created by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The Add @-@ on button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After page ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width .
cutting tool After page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it &apos;s always the same regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to cut to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the setup aid settings allow you to hide aids in order to better put your pictures together . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious pitches are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third gel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle with similar harmonic tri@@ angles aligned on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition results in a look of the viewer along the lines of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way .
a further rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that can be a line or different objects . this can be just there without directing the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equally angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can let a static object appear dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the pres@@ et button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the automatic cut function . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option leaves the picture a bit after the turn . however , take note of the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping from image processing .
the sh@@ ading tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
drag your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane .
a vertical and horizontal line is displayed to your help . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ading tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ ear@@ ing produces twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ations cro@@ pping from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods for digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Configuration section , you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of rough formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often recorded in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understand these formats and will not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; use the movies to play movies to start playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you &apos;ve gone back before .
synchron@@ izes the metadata between the database and all the files of the current main window . the images inherit the metadata of the database and not in any other way as in this menu .
menu entry of the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual , automatic turning / mirr@@ oring for the current image based on orientation in the EX@@ IF information .
sorting all images in the current album by their name , path , date , file size or their rating .
the metadata bank will be over@@ written by the data of the files in the event of any discre@@ pan@@ cies . the other variant can be started from the Album menu .
all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please refer to the Camera section for more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module that exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a consistent dialog which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the range below the selected preview area .
vertically split . the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are marked .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the trays downloaded by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are stored in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select it . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the Add Color check@@ box is activated under the Button Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check box under In@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs included , are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; calcul@@ ates the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . at first , if you run &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum com@@ min@@ ution of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later you can proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ graphs ; ... use , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graphs ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the Setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph will be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph you come to a page should be fitted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one of several pages distributed graph@@ ene without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Upload page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can define a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or specify to be asked at any start .
the context menu , which is usually displayed at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up further options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph@@ ene file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ executed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Change Col@@ ors and the grid net in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog will appear where you can choose whether to create the symbol from a template or whether you want to restart from scratch .
restore the last step back . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
paste the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the dot you click on .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
paste the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three sides template for symbols , background and symbol grid .
with the Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove buttons you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or show lin@@ e@@ ale and set one color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency display . you can also set the size : the kar@@ os to small , medium and large as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images provide tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ red@@ he &apos;s default values in order to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window is fully displayed as some settings might not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window for setting the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and your family around the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of creating a token , so it is used for your authentication . it is , therefore , your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the export module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which indicates the current permissions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need write permission . the module does not currently support other auth@@ oriz@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once you have set all the other options . using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking the O@@ k button will start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the access permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value specified at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the C@@ IP@@ I module gallery ex@@ porting is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the geographical location of the K@@ IP@@ I module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ are can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to make a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were taken back at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracks are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one location for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation options and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and press the cor@@ relations button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog has the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to place the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the selection allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ shows
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which of course also affects file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if an error occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ ash@@ outs . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size rises because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please allow exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG coding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG enco@@ ders can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between each image you can insert a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of slide show .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re @-@ set the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is fixed below . a low value generates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the extension pole possible .
if you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie using the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you &apos;re back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right down .
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original part of it is : don &apos;t expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG version can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame remains the same , and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , preserves all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . so use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progres@@ ses .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ ize res@@ ize in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ Mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you selected . click the Add Photos button to add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button Rem@@ ove pictures the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the sending emails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used each time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format under the File menu File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG on image file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original ex@@ if@@ data are added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Slideshow , a window with questions like your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Advertising option makes it possible to display the file name of the images in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually leave with Es@@ c . Cancel .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
the temporal distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , every transition between the images will select a different effect .
during slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide .
at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current filen@@ ame , position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has not currently been documented . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ stage is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , there are now keywords in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined by yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not own suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify the image for each individual person to be displayed . to do this , you need to open the image editor window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu . in the Ad@@ sich@@ ts window , you can customize the image for the appropriate person and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties .
if you enter a string into the label or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the entire date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here it is shown on pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try the same functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu item to start photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try it .
if you &apos;d rather like to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name says , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the Tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual describes the in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML Ex@@ ample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page . read more about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without any description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . please note that all images are from a party . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of this page you can set up various resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you must select the root folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can verify that they are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set to output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a lot of time for it , you need to apply the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file , which can import others to your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of saving all the pictures into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass that file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will not be found . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting pictures that you can view through File Ex@@ porting ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal ZIP files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from File Import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons belonging to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse pictures and look at : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting up the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images , but it has been expanded and today it is taking care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are saved and used it automatically for future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu item Settings k@@ PT@@ album ; setting up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual , you will find the various settings options .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can invoke by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it has been described how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in this section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
view the settings that are available to you for setting up the member groups . with the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left pane , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are shared among each other together , it can be that the modules were tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures ; demo database can be viewed either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between photo@@ album and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album must be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums .
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , it will do so , so do so , so if you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can search your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information , since you do not yet have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to comment on each image with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , all pictures are shown by Jes@@ per and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by assign@@ ing people , places and keywords . they are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always be able to use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by the fact , that the names used are moved up to find and classi@@ fy people more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may still want to edit all the selected images and tag them with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the top right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all of these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new super@@ structure or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place there to sort it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you are currently sorting your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can drag and move the elements of the comment dialog by drag@@ ging and moving the elements that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options ... that offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry image in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , and try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it is shown in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and either click the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , use pictures without saving you on the hard disk . of course , you must have saved the images somewhere , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and back in . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support you until now , if you want to avoid inser@@ ting the affected CD . so , if you are angry about how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those remaining that you want to make accessible to others and click on current view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and select the menu entry Any@@ thing but current view .
this allows you to set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is not very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images .
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . this you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and disc@@ ard them somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on this , the browser will show you the appropriate entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and final image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply draw a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom in again The Plus button is zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point @-@ key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed in . with the direct key sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can cancel this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the possibility to add images with characteristics while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in this picture you see a picture , where the characters A , B and C are set .
this can be seen in the browser . you can then use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after selecting the image . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to picture &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the ch@@ amo@@ is is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in order to switch to the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to turn on the image , select painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Add menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear so that you can choose the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly again or reject the changes with Cancel .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility Level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window ordering as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown to the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a given view , drag the but@@ t to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the tap to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map @-@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the but@@ t onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing at the top pointing arrow in the side@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
you can save the current window view with View Window arrangement ... save it . it displays a dialog by which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog is opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the sub@@ section sub@@ section and enter the image detail for rendering into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ation field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling includes the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is spl@@ itted again and again , because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold , then both pixels are comp@@ uted by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra pixels is calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated radi@@ ations have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import an &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation of the displayed object . here you can find the path to your document and the version .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object by@@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you check the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you check the bottom , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you check edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . the window orders section explains how you can create and store window orders .
the Standard Window System Com@@ bin@@ ation field : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed all the error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar . read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points where you can change the target of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
if you click the App@@ ly button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite final layer . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree closely , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom by clicking the + icon in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise one unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a few in the moment .
the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview shows only a matte black material , because you still have to enter the pig@@ ments settings . therefore , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already simply execute this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , place a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the brightness effect and reflection are already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should have a good idea of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus , the scene is processed pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saving will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , key short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to the default short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
opens a dialog for setting the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a dump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump seper@@ ately on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the application has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file browser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where you can select images to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ing - &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background color , which you can set further down . pres@@ et is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ou@@ ting ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; but@@ ton@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ch@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ p show , so that only a few of the file types can be displayed that can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field .
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show here ; in the cardboard cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
res@@ ets the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reporting problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to ask you to answer other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you must select in the menu Settings show@@ foto . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar on the right side , providing important information and actions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures that do not do more than scan and store images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SA@@ NE page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel is &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly treat these options .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if you &apos;re pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without asking for a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images automatically stored and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric ke@@ yp@@ ix that is numbered every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs key short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting up global keyboard short@@ cuts .
you may possibly set existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard go to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
start require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is using the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure is the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece will be picked up . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions you might query more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume initi@@ ates a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as an Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts site of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;re just looking for a particular item for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you still find it difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music according to certain criteria .

da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compile options certain dependen@@ cies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the System requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
to view the player window , the player window will additionally turn on to the playlist and / or . if the option is disabled , only the playlist window is displayed ( Ju@@ K ) .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
drop mood files from the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : allows you to choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end of the page .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , it becomes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
up @-@ to @-@ date items can be seen in the play change , that the play@@ lists window is / rolled up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window .
when changing the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fonts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browser . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color selection included among them for foreground and background color .
resume playback at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if own colors are not activated , the default colors are used .
the display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further setting options in this card card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set the folder to be used with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the folders and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is still necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that the database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the memory card last@@ .@@ f@@ m specifies the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can retrieve the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer using bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer using bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this will lead to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the fault is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV ( 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ r@@ ors when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Re@@ play / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are easily forgotten . this can be done in the Control Center under Visual Identi@@ ty symbols . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ tray _ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if there is something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist .
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the surface intuitive , the Start sub @-@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the playlist will be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be called noisy media types supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / MAS / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any audio format only . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are provided in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat ® mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ding them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS deco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ C co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less supports react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . run the Batch @-@ Register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with Batch @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the log register again .
if you have a list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current title when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username using your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control strip ?
click &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can not be created and many error messages appear on the console . what then ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click the Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Macro@@ F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
this is basically the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right clicking on the piece and clicking Edit : select app@@ rais@@ al or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want you to specify when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release schedule that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and set the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context browser design , click New Design to install ....

the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please see the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How to fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output is the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio &lt; type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio &lt; type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog from x@@ ine now and the output is done on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box supported by sound card m@@ map .

M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , allowing you to read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files in order to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MP : a full featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As will display with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then pause between saving and changes . furthermore , you can ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what should be done with it , just as if you have called C@@ lose for each project file .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called C@@ lose file .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature removes any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
this enables copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium also without project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting of black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar currently appears in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Content View allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the Content View is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header bar is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key assignment .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example over a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task are more relevant , which of the enclosed programs give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line utility . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String _ New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Core CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it can easily be read and saved in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ) and many encoding that encoding these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ ders need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( as a rule one per title ) are compressed in the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . however , all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install anything yourself .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanism of copy protection . avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while set @-@ up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use to read out a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , about which you will stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . see the step by step example for more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the Settings tab in the encoding settings tab , the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already used file is selected for coding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ages ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , for setting the encoder ) , you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides fla@@ c there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied free with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo equipment . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and au@@ ster@@ oids . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ stated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be inflic@@ ted damage . all information can be obtained anyway at a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for this ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre@@ defined records for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab for setting the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab itself .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about the enco@@ ders can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about the switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 &apos;s keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , since it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it using the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what should be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD ;
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , let &apos;s share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to load the &amp; CD ; to download the data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; if you have found the right settings .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work , or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab will help to get a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here you don &apos;t have much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
please select only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when missing keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop down sel@@ ector is simpler , will find a &amp; CD ; entry will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory or filen@@ ame is changed with the directory order &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database in advance . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two boxes need to be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load between the hosts is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but since many fire@@ walls run the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the 80 protocol , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to provide any &amp; CD ; transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of pieces at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are saved . if the box is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
just enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each read out of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section , we will describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , has been set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is established , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , then the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search the FAQ section and answer the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the artist &apos;s name and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database using the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments as individual per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments which are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the Help button for more information .
for more information go to the homepage of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the play list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when you click the Select button to read the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the Ri@@ der to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is read out on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error when trying to work with a coding that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration option to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it already ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help such as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . best read the step by step , for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different learning flash@@ cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to add or change something useful , let it do . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oc@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics , the other &amp; UNIX ® players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as a sequ@@ encer is supported .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the method used .
session support . if you quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the entry from the It@@ em menu or press Space .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the tempo LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the It@@ em , interrup@@ ts playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics of lyrics and others . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . however , if you select an automatic text selection from the Settings menu , the Kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected , but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a type of event , select the Text and Rec@@ on events entries from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the previous one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the Add add . it appears again in the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu drop@@ down sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order they have been added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next Song button , next song from the It@@ em menu , or press the arrow button on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events which the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type , thus making a trumpet sound when playing a piano .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required compositions for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you will specify how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and also leave a row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that need this instrument to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are used above all to map sound to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the included keywords .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to replace the first and the second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Wall option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio displays in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der occur@@ ren@@ ces are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard , which gets a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . the MIDI Settings menu can be found in the Settings menu .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see what sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
in agreement , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , do not enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have opened a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or sh@@ rou@@ ded ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; switch windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the mi@@ di files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as a hobby , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve always written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I want to stress that I only programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .

a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile it with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the site The K@@ DE website for new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when there is information in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and stored playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . to click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and select next editing mode . by cli@@ pping a sub @-@ group only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation during starting does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of start animation can be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / mm@@ gt ; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; supported .
there is one tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; this must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end is always taken for a given mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , use the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ dr@@ source .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is a user root after the device is plug@@ ged . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom will appear on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ?

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile and install .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the box ; -@@ website .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within it a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management have to be called .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to know its possibilities , the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex can also be used ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . in order to exercise correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified and a k@@ per with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the k@@ per begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
document Clas@@ ses : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or Custom .
encoding : the encoding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list includes the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; latex ; for integration , they must only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , L@@ etter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
automatic execution of the environments is created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin @-@ command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
with the view of the document in the structure view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files , the return search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when searching for a link , the elements of the DVI ; file are merged with the editor and as soon as an item is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; source text is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex is cli@@ cked , the corresponding location is spec@@ kled in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on @-@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are on it , and there is no call for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ey@@ epi@@ ece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; after the quick construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection areas should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of joint elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Sel@@ ection field More is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , nodes or references . the options available are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , a picture or another element .
reference : used for reference to a defined term ( select a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; files can also be written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gra@@ ph will be used for defining the font size . you can specify the font width for the main text , the joints , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu or the quick build of the button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , logging in should be sought after the errors . when using quick construction , it should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( eng@@ l. environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font height 12 will be created and only a few bags should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows to add the change of the font size within the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , it may be added to certain fonts , grease , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid as long as it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed ital@@ ically with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin @-@ rate } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now followed for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , you should make a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , there should be a quote , a few passages in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the case of an internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a volume @-@ dependent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different kinds of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed with file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the transformation into selected other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar .
the advance search allows the direct jump from the editor to the attached position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; binding files . to do this , you just need to set up Modern with Settings ... Building up tools .
to search for the advance search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source code and cli@@ cked on pre@@ destination search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then executed .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; file by &amp; ki@@ le ; opened and bound to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; can be specified as text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using Quick @-@ Construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not open , an error may occur . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log @-@ in file or in the message window .
the log file tells the source code in the source code . in the editor , the pop@@ up can be used in the source code . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be either written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
high @-@ level users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings may be replaced with other data ( such as name or character encoding ) .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are being replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps have to be performed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the default one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; box ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its options , the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly by reading the chapter .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical and latex ; command reference , which can be called on the menu help La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; latex , as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a cli@@ cked Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex differ ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can include additional marks within the text . this is a custom type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ or Edit High@@ marks or the corresponding key can also be highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent opportunities , have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; &amp; latex ; always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ cks ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . with a paragraph not a text is meant with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning closes with tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; box ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word from the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; latex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility .
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description for editing select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides ; for further instructions under Edit environment for a more balanced simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { surround } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , the above overview can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those of Edit environment .
with this command , jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the shrink sleeve .
with this command , jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the shrink @-@ closing bracket .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the lo@@ osen clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted groups braces , the above overview can quickly be lost . this command includes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as a liquid . for the purpose @-@ bringing implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple suits . also for the end of the application , the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and completes two closing suits for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in custom settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key , &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line switch . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close a table environment , close &amp; tilt the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent new@@ line .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to enable this . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the next line .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ...
at the beginning a new environment is started using the command \ \ begin { Environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add command \ \ end { Environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the return key the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to enlarge the list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are , of course , removed when selecting a command . alternatively , it can be added by &amp; Ki@@ le , so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jumps is possible and the selected parameters can then be added .
under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can make settings on these lists . it can be selected different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands , as well as walls of common language use .
the mode command mode is not useful for exec@@ uting environments . it must always have a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the execution mode calls for a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ cks ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the full finish mode over the menu full environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically added to the environment and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ cks ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Box ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; En@@ able can make settings to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art modes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of queries that are immediately replaced by more expensive strings . the lists can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be fully implemented . as an example of a list box , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included , for example .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word assignment mode added to the Edit menu or the key C@@ trl + Alt space key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big payment processors are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many documents are written more than once in a document . with this , &amp; Ki@@ le provides for all already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings ... Ki@@ le can be completely destroyed . here you can also set the threshold for displaying the full damage .
the full files can be installed in the folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( serial ) or tex .
the graphics dialog displays the creation of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , create and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file using the old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ bound viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being added to the Project New Project .... For this , the following information is asked for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated with scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the correct document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the little application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ cks ; delivered documents and there@@ for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . by &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly and latex ; - / tex ; source editor which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , so &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continu@@ ance of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and spend a lot of hours for the development of tools that we can use all while respecting the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sign@@ atures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you can create random sign@@ atures or day sign@@ atures from a list . this command line interface provides sign@@ atures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random sign@@ atures any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sign@@ atures with different quotes , styles and information you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day sign@@ atures the same signature is read from the signature file for the whole day . for each day you use different sign@@ atures , as with the random sign@@ atures you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . thus you get a lt ; empty sign@@ atures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on &amp; lt ; empty sign@@ atures ; and paste in the bottom of your new signature . signature example Kon@@ qi con@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl + S file or click the Save icon .
you can create as many sign@@ atures as you like . then you have a list of sign@@ atures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sign@@ atures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the symbol with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we still lift it one piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! no more instructed on a terminal ; simply click and finish the icon for the XML processor !
this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the war@@ med working folder , then leave the current working folder cli@@ cked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time my Outlook is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the just opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then just leave the current working folder . if not , then select current work folders and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already tagged in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick on current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check selection .
for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Relax NG check is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then just let the current file be selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or K@@ Part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in Edit . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze tab . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold after which they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how to set up such conductors .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the comment entries from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword followed in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the recru@@ ited nick@@ name of the team member , role plays a role in the project resulting from the following possibilities :
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible through the Settings menu . here , only above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta setting . this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . entries are :
big / L@@ ump@@ y of Tags : cap@@ itali@@ zation of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ onal files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lower case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ onal files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately added to the tag .
automatically closing non @-@ optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and end tag : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic insertion of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise than file @-@ open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is om@@ itted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; create backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset window settings to default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the Par@@ ser and the Struc@@ ture Tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the Struc@@ ture tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture Tree Configuration area , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ out abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied loading . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct , then it is possible to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ developed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been adjusted as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be respected .
the counterpart to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to run a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution continues . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will start .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to clean up in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adjust to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities like car completion and h@@ ubs . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folder includes two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders are handy , symbolic key of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool lists allow quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without any risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they contain only file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder name the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself nothing else .
the type of tag is a script function . when used it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just @-@ element type element .
returns the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current day .
a container tag grouped together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check is done only when loading the tag XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
below is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; super@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the designated settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ .@@ This is how to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be sub@@ stituted with the PID of the current and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field , input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , to the default output , can be specified by setting the output sel@@ ector output to the default output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Pre@@ ferences .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog if available so that an input while using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in view of the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar button to set the toolbar settings . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by quot@@ ing all symbols to make sure everything works .
backup in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its file name ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you must search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you must create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second one we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag _ html tag 3 = tag 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP ; documentation for something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files to be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file which serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of con@@ cre@@ ted context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an e @-@ mail sent menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . to make an online contribution , we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ ging format . there is the easier way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog will appear :
destination Directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and complete these concepts , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available to everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . using actions is all that is selected as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree that can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the tab drivers with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other , or all cardboard tri@@ g@@ gering , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , spr@@ inging to a bookmark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor pane to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing of the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is used as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of the editor window , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ Plans ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with tab drivers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands will open in relation to the navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree @-@ views . with it , you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the system @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be reached using useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this critic displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other save and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the site of the source script ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . summari@@ zed already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , what has someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework not only this is all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ old Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts the special character to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts text from clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; Description which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
to@@ gg@@ les the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and turning of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter gets activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents are grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . see chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects will explain the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... added . toolbar buttons are saved using tool@@ bars toolbar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the toolbar at the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and if there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu item in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of toolbar until this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . click on an activated plug@@ ins de@@ activated it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode that matches the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ gg@@ les the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
specifies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
this should generate help according to the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically , e.g. after filling out the project name . all these paths and author information fields can be set up later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can select an exact selection according to your own man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . in the menu with Project Properties , these settings can be uploaded to the Profile tab in the Profile window or with the Shift key short@@ cut ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as Project Fol@@ ders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Profile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking its own tree view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the team configuration window , members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window one can disable event actions and add , modify or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , it opens and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you cannot influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or icon project open from the toolbar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders also behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu which can be activated with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Program@@ ming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the record store option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this doesn &apos;t have to be changed unless the network administrator doesn &apos;t run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method .
as already mentioned above , toolbar buttons are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to customize the toolbar . use and add are different . adding tool@@ bars is handled in the addition of tool@@ bars at the bottom of the page .
the toolbar and icons can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be removed , the toolbar can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified , what actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action is displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and specify Settings .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets , and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a basic file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or associate existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you present for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can include any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using int@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you can create a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the document based on a template , but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or per@@ l .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As templates save as local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As templates store select as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag@@ ging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ define he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or associate files with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop down sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when parent attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set in such a way , it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a regular folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ building block . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows you to pre @-@ set or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and , by copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers , can already furnis@@ h a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second pane spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when needed , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously , and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously , this mode is already active , offset the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small gap for fast computers and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the Docum@@ entation dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and er@@ ased by means of return key or removal button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other drop anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool to study style sheets . unlike other style sheets , search for certain elements is possible and the style template exec@@ uting can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully you need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without a path . filen@@ ames in the same folder as the up@@ loading style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a default called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP template that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be terminated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a minor night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this feature turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the filen@@ ame of the first file . example :
fol@@ lic@@ 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o destination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
open dialog allows the manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup knob opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start compar@@ isons / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a reference window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red for that . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is shown dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info row with the output output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic merging already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
when only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current pane and on the left a black bar appears .
this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if selecting sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters as well .
navig@@ ating is mainly navig@@ ated with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w also can be used by other programs .
in the window window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merging section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if it is checked , it is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copying manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could thus acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed lo@@ gically . in these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board , copying manually into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line \ &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others may look identical in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , although they are different . if this option is checked , this option will be disabled . during merging , this option must be disabled .
in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed on .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merging menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details see documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must exit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding , a brief reference appears , which is the local code . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
switch this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window side by side or overl@@ apping each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . merging the merging menu will also work if you just compare two files . a simple click starts merging and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give users greater flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all these are followed by a $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processor command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so almost er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you may also use something else , such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / Create / SCH@@ AL@@ TER . How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm predic@@ ts .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merging and display the simulated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merging of individual files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared until then are listed .
when the scanning of the folders is complete shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of any problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be the same if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B visible as visible file name for the output file ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged , and the option New file instead of merging ( unsure ) is enabled , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merging , a file will be processed after the other . you status column shows skill when merging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if merging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected for Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , C is used as destination in the Three folder merge mode , B is chosen as target and used when synchron@@ izing A and / or B as destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge action , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options passing , simul@@ ating and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , start / continue / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 puts an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you wish to try another action for the entry , or to solve the problem in a different way before you merge with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again during the later compilation . even if merging is ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a pre@@ defined point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links are treated like normal folders and checked recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 does not check for possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is turned off to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare just the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date is lost . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
enables synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the new file , it is suggested as an action . ( this is considered uncertain because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible while merging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder merge . to do this , the status will be set to be completed and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive to a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative und@@ et@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters need to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished as to whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( this is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select Add In K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
there are tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can perform together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or let him go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the row is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c appears ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install , on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options with the Update function . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
when you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
this option is disabled in default . under@@ far@@ ew@@ ells in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works in both desktop and multiple .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; when cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager ... and exit . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimum , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ inary Fig@@ ures , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to allow their selection .
the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; Main Window can be specified : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in an 2x@@ N grid appear , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual working surfaces in horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for the representation side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents .
right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switch settings ... allows the dialog box to appear .
at the moment this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . below is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; key , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Zoom &amp; etc ; .
k@@ likes also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use an area of screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those with mouse click pains . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse pain . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the motion .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the pull with pressed mouse button . the intelligent delay requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied at the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if smart post@@ p@@ one is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it leaves the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports mouse shift click . if this feature activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last push of the user .
it is best to use a m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent delay should be switched off at first . if you then have used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the intelligent delay .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease sounds .
first , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . by doing so , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , place the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title rows of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy and paste text into the clip@@ board or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the intelligent move if you are just starting &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , mark the text as follows : enter a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is used every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shutter speed starts when smart moves . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed ; this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is blin@@ d@@ folded . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to play .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag @-@ drop to start before the mouse button is left . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer talk for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passages book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the vocabulary for words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the wor@@ ding lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sc@@ rolling memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have spoken correctly , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the processor memory . you can select sets that are to be re @-@ spoken .
with the menu item Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the card card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , you specify the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Aut@@ ot@@ ext entry menu or in the list of text passages .
with the selection of Instant words the chosen passage passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the processor memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected passage passage is entered first only in the input field .
the second drop @-@ down window allows you to specify whether the text log message is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to reject any changes , the text log book is not saved . select Before saving , it becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text log message is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of words of words . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you set a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided in two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , in the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the default memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar can be displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly from the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the smart left side and pull the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar at the toolbar . by clicking on the button on the left and pull the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications free of charge .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ ax@@ e and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be app@@ ended . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / ji@@ ax@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ over@@ s dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can be able to print text through the computer . a list of spoken pro@@ positions is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include any voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar ; or start k@@ help@@ .exe help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is part of modules of existing service allowing each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; node ; applications .
the speech output is performed using the speech dispens@@ er program , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language expendi@@ tures on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ over@@ s service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ul@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
additionally to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list of links to the k@@ de @-@ mailing list . you can subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ para .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust it correctly .
when the first start of kt@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the board card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card General is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card player speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the board card is displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet a speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click this button to move the speaker in the list a row further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a tun@@ er here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a female and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the map board Spo@@ kes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if Voice Output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de . see now . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de voice output system . click on the tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
tick this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the cart@@ on map will be displayed , and you can create text jobs and read before . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the system area of the control strip while reading , it disappears once the reading has been completed .
using the buttons in this row , you can start , stop , stop and resume text jobs .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the cart@@ on card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and enable Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ No@@ tify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the message system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events you set . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up so that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry appears No@@ ti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
filter for string replacement provides a good way to correct in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong st@@ ressing or wrong @-@ spoken messages . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after issuing the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you assign from the card card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a read@@ out , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
string replac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . it can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre @-@ defined string replac@@ ements that allow the creation of chat @-@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; transform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the board card for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts is sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will display the following setup di@@ alogs .
for setting string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string specified in column Hei@@ ght . the list is executed from top to bottom in the order shown .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from one file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key when the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the indicated applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only copy .
the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions with an entry in the box refer to the filter if the filter works . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can add it in the Add or Edit dialog as help to assemble these expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package label .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formation . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the voice selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker set up on the board card , or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker designed on the board card . with the voice selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . ist on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to store or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the Voice Output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ H via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Voice Output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice specification via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ reform@@ ist filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . furthermore , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are any problems with specific characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the Syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that is not included in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and comp@@ ress , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ chs or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the configuration of speech dispens@@ ers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual phrases . the user can return , repeat , pause or cancel pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases or sets .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it can be used , otherwise automatically the best suitable speaker is selected . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click on the Add @-@ In Ticket to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the card board speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you set volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and these are displayed gray , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet installed a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon of kt@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board spokesperson .
with the buttons in this series you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will become a symbol in the system segment . click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card Audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about &amp; kt@@ ys news types ; see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed on the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device .
set the microphone Spe@@ ech Speed here . 50 % equal to half and 200@@ 0.@@ - % about twice the normal microphone speed . to make these settings happen , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must figure out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text jobs . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and screen readers if they are interrupted by sending a message with a higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the No@@ tify news , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications .
check this check box to enable reading &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card board . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a last option , the action will be carried out which is set under standard ( all other events ) .
the All No@@ ti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the notification settings to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete .
Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations exist :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone ( British ) voice as this is the default voice that the festival uses in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds do not divide text into individual sentences . this allows &amp; kt@@ ys to start reading faster , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . this allows you to skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you can see the set of set limits . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of set limits is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limits , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speakers selection and enter text for reading . check the list of speakers , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker has changed . you must of course have more than one speaker setup , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the cart@@ on card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set level recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be disabled , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ ups and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab sign are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ set filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set of set filters from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kart@@ ei@@ karte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voice selection , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed when you select &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the upper one on the card board ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a built @-@ in speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the original features .
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
select this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker sel@@ ector and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case 0 is written for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , you may install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ m@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals . as a guide , please send a patch to the developers together with the URL you found .
at the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; - after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ys ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file formats into S@@ aber @-@ Tags for converting SS@@ ML . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I added an own string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more replac@@ ements left or backward . on the cart@@ es@@ plan@@ ter orders is shown , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for set limits .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or newer . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can call the st @-@ register command . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system is also included , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes when you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
with July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of speech speed , but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install as x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
do you have &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option column shows the configure parameter which causes the passing of creation .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the option --@@ pre@@ fix = goal . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to pre @-@ read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
this voice pres@@ umes Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone for the voices . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice @-@ sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ phone . Festival creates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce Di@@ Phone from German text .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder Festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list that best suits your distribution and release . when setting the setting , the definition can be made permanently . when you start setting the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to be edited in the Settings dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be done at the same time . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the manual can be used without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot time . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off on demand . switching on an out@@ dated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on your needs . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the host IP address in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain specification by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can understand IP addresses . if the machine asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine for nam@@ esp@@ ou@@ ting part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and ascending or herr@@ ing in the list with the buttons Hin@@ di or herr@@ ings in priority .
by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
select an entry from the group calcul@@ ator and click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be displayed .
the list of name @-@ known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace the DNS server .
usually the list includes some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ak@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog box .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to Edit Your Computer will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command is set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile it . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second one is discussed all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this section does not replace any further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact person who is running a valid IP address or , if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if another content is found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you can see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; use the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ members the band and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; not the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the band , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the template , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the band . floppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; k@@ dat , proceed with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check the menu item .
once the test is started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over ....
once the restore process is started , the Settings dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery .
when you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the index@@ .html file on the basis of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup job :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up Settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape machine .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
is the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection on tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when the connection is removed , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option from floppy disk drives .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ calibr@@ ated block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive is reported .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
the remaining files on the tape are tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Log@@ s . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your machine in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides users with quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features that allow filtering and evaluation of protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features that can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . will not show you this , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the directory / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter for a selected criteria or string . the list of log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed that match the selected filter . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down field contains the All . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column . in the protocol file system log , select the process column , and then enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than protocol lines of level critic . the color representation of protocol lines can be disabled .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for monitoring program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further down to historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start when moving the system or switching to another run level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ Level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something mess@@ ed up then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to any of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script ends with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . moreover , I could have a user @-@ run level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other poin@@ ter device is simple to avoid telling tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six runner @-@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new range . in order to only copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run level , move it to the clip@@ board with cut @-@ out ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired runner @-@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the port number or the name of an entry , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card management card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group file on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are in KB size :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system file system
the card card group informs about the group dependen@@ cies of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
