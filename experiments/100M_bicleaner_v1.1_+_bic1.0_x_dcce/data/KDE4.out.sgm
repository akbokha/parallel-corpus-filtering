<seg id="1">To translate the website you will find in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Web Page. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">The translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made on the translations without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can directly insert translation texts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror, select Setting Extensions.... Open the CartesCard Tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde paddons package. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & konqueror; on Extras crash. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module pagefilter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; it's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM Tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentware, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of visualising nested folders hierarchies using a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; it reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily identified, can be easily recognized if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful ink and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is at all displayed, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby therefore display errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With rendering algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this objective is not always complied with. frames are drawn to make the nesting of entries no longer available. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation remains up to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labeling and preventing space losses through boxes to divide rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; intended as a small testing application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras View picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the module image gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set up the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The File Name box of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">By displaying the image size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images below the thumbnails is shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "in the" "" "Dialogue" "" "folder, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders will be included." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">In the File Selection in HTML file, enter where the HTML page is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set the subfolder with a slider or a script, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the original pictures to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment box in the box to specify a comment file for the description of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to general & HTML; Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">Media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; menu under the navigation pane, or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser Detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add the browser and operating system identifier for single domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web site that deny access to this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that reject access by browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages which do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser acknowledgement is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="54">The module web-archive is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and take your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit colour space and all available modules support raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you to answer other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site to see news about released versions and other information on & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get in & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digiBuy; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here the data will be stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use you as an alb library. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing images as base folder. & digikam; view each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; endures recursively to the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. you can do this by adding a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have any pictures as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can in & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Criteria to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw-mode of your camera, then & digikam; possibly bypass it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported rough cameras in the Help RohCamera Support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and take your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, further distributed software collection for digital cameras that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and carries out the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support to read the preview images from digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may possibly be unable or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digikam, is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Dragging and dropping images works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the Albentag, above the horizontal dividing line or another application window. the only restriction is that you can't put a picture into words, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. in this way, the filter works on the file name only if this ind is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSetup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. just select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to right-click on the album and select album properties from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method of marking your albums so that you can be grouped together under a common name. the collection you choose will be used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete collections from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The eldest, average, New Year's buttons: these set the date to the oldest, newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digimode, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Keyword List at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two louver buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a short while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by regenerating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is this, you can change settings. choose the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the Introduction section in the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can view all the functions that are edited with & digiti. You can choose between viewing images, slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... selecting. in the Edit section you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with the image processing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing other image editing programs, you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for turning. the easiest is to right-click on the preview and select Rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want a photo of & digikam, delete it, it is moved to the garbage bins of & kde; moved F8 image Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the calendar to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as one keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywording quot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword, or on an existing keyword, and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword becomes the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu will appear that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by selecting it with the right mouse button and selecting keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In order to be able to use keywords, you must first tag your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the keyword in the tree & quot; My keywording; alternatively, you can click on the thumbnails and select keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have attached a photo with keywords, this will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu will display only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a timeally adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the box that indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search is found. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has nothing found, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can search this search here as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and search is done. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection again, you only need to select the appropriate entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select an advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed clockwise, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / delete search group or deleted from it. each option can be combined with others through the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least.... furthermore, you can create searching of type & quot; AND NOTHING.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes every image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they match. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand ink sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. also here, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofile.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; establishes a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem icon from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window is opened. if you are back in & digimode; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select a preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or deportation operations on one of the pictures, then you will compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions work directly from the luminaire like F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the luminaire. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivelling function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click on them and hold the & LMB; in the Preview mode, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in as well as in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when previewing in mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos receiveth, scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this, however, not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the process for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we view the download, rename, delete, convert, group, secure, evaluate, listen, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. according to your definition, metadata is data that can provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you do not even know how many photos you have, then use no inventory management to find a particular photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use definitely not & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant import of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in & digikam; this ensures EXIF- and IPTC data is written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? add & digikam; you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now starts the real work, since you now have to assign keywords, labels and an appraisal to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. it makes sense as you can focus on the best photos when working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you might even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motive you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of pictures. KDE even exports you a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is moving already with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through pictures with geographic data. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denies the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all amended versions, thus also for works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the direction page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the job description of the photographer. examples of this can be title like: employee, freelance photographer or independant commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image. for private individuals, this protection is very important for the majority of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, disk failure, current breaches, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, proliferation aberrations</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, we are dealing with problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled cautiously and you may not trust you for more than a few years. of course you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect itself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sum. despite this massive protection, they age them through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks appear to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said about CDs and DVDs is also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device to high-quality media in a non-expropriate format. then read the data back to check you. likewise, you should store the media with a description, date & author and store them on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk fault study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you operate at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperatures, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART may not detect these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment doesn't matter much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause frozen keypads, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and stores the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains surge protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should be aware that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that also all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers also provide overvoltage protective devices, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with current disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs ensure at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have to open a photo one day and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for Linux; it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in the case of notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is deteriorating. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anyone else for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash struck you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for a data loss despite backup is panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, retained IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">So if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume you have set the scalability with you and want to increase the area you want to expand on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command whether your new record is recognized by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBO; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadh1 # change the size of the reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can be read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open format format designed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use Canon and Nikon's competitors at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe's XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms, which allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the rough format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve widespread adoption of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera map, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. they may be cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to WebGaleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the addition of a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator appears at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars Properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these pictures have not yet been edited by & digikam. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the All File or Selected buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums will be displayed, such as normal folders.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK and & digikam; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting All Delete. if you just want to delete a few, you must select them first and delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check whether the photos were uploaded into a & digitized version before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera's menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate file names if you load photos from different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for date-based subtitles. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two will affect the information about the author in the section standard car identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file name option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase, or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed under the name shown by the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of the shooting to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turning is usually switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, lets & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic turning, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available, can & digikam; use this to automatically upload sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case save & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button to select the Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button Download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, check & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position that is indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised; user who wants to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map reference. the question is actually more about how the data enters these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last via manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLRRicoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsor or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExiTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals comfortably created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street cards. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you must select in the Settings menu. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or Start Image Processing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright information. these data are automatically written into the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should include the photographer's profession. these can be designations like e.g. stellar photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here since this is the image of others & quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; these metadata also has other programs and can be added to & digikam; without going to be lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this way your labels can also be read from other image viewers. attention: for images that already contain captions, they are overwritten by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in one & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the luminaire these settings are turned on. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should use only fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn off the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the Deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning process.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is evolving very quickly into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default image is that all green pixels are equal. if the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, you eliminate this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance, which is based on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details in the top lights in four steps. this option is ignored for other cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as penetrating white. use the setting to loosen sweeping white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as quick saturate as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option Reconstructing, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the part raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenization Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color gradient correction since you are performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Issues When an image is opened in the image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Create this folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digikam; investigate these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles You have here the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures do not color the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, drapie Gamma isn't corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate how your picture would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print a picture, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately not with the models from Canon. hence, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the Image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will then be loaded by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Setting Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn on the metadata that appears at the lower end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left are a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Recognition, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin you can set the talk of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used when you use the option to apply changes to the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you must save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see & digikam the display of the welcome screen; when starting, it may accelerate the start process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Swim Start after new photos is forcing & digikam; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam, you asked if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or using the context menu of the preview and selection of the Item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with Save As File.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File menu or using the button Restore the Image Processing restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit or Restore Edit by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl, -Z to undo and ctrl-Shift-Z to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the score menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnifying factor automatically select</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, you can edit the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can edit this in the Settings dialog from & digikam. you can view it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; printing dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Wizard from the Album menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigation arrows, also available in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The Text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should follow these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field, following the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sample view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword's IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this only applies to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please refer to the keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. usually the left sidebar with their album, - Date, keyword and search is used. if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords in the main view. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog will appear which asks you whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images, and then a keyword from the right keyword will be dragged to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in Settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can select an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable derogation of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colours you print or publish in the web that correspond to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed choices at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use a different color space and make thoughts about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, please visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB color space or not, you must calibrate your monitor because sRGB assumes that your; onitor is installed on sRGB. if you work as in the sRGB color space then you must either calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a fitting monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, Same, Automatic Same and Contrast extend from the Correct Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values across the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest dot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a Magi correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparisons: this method adjusts the luminous actuator of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also only produces trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border shades and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a rejize of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted as you work over a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjusting lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Returns buttons make exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set you can save in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button again resets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you store this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, calculus time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar ionization, also called Sabatier, was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure of a short flash beam and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called "quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by giving a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers. Velvia's strong saturated colours are too much for a few photographers, especially those who hardly decompose landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repeats the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under Colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">Also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the slide for the application here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, an active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into it and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinching can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources, and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. in this case, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker. if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipettes buttons, you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and solar tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposure pixels. if in more than one channel, the combined result is displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminance canal. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digikam; editing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color gradations of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness, even if you also use the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer is then the tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. color space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer setting allows you to save for later and then load it. the used file format is the gimbp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option to preserve Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film role profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Pan 5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenticular filter. this looks good, with all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lenticular filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Smacaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth resp. three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame can be added a decorative box to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image. through a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoning effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percentage. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any position. this can also be done at several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool to apply template you can place a template using an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Stencil apply in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your templates to & digikam; email list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your templates folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will update the template's thumbnail automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to zoom the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but it generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make an image sharper look. indeed, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychosuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitization process needs to be summarised with minimal differences at a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more retrospeculation than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images, a camera is often used in internal sharpening. however, pictures in the rough-format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a depth of field while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. this allows you to go to Correct Archives using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal carefully with this, because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is to refocus the tool.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit softly is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool for softness with the menu item Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing Schleier from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The preview window will help you to edit the picture. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, rough edges and the impression of grenades can create close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should preferably sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount determines the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. this will cause the sharpness of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). fuzzy mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß's folding is even strongly influenced by the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurred gauge is authentic. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasurable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by sharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the error correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the blurring of the range that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tints allow an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the picture. whereas larger values mostly smooth homogenous regions and make details sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film grain or a CCD wheel will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, place this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long run time. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you get by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend that you omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Locking buttons make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artefacts. the module is used in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensory noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">The radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically thicker, but also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur on the edges. it can remove the noise spikes and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften the soft sign with the menu item Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitides; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local flaws that appear in digital, original or later digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce JPEG photos: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; artefactequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Locking buttons make exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and this corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool hotpixel allows to remove hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera close to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel tags; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic corners (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting corrections is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposure corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, the vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise insensitivity effects occur due to movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter with the large exposures area of today's film and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners. the tool of Vignetting corrections applies the transformation with a center filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker's copyright.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting corrector filter and three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly to a luminous intensity of 2. increase density by a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting corrections reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image editing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting corrections applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grader covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth density corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree. negative values can be corrected in tonal distortions and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth density. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the inverted character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resets the image size and thus causes a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction at first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a sound-shaped correction, the effect would obviously be the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the cropping tool in the menu Transformers cropping from image editing or using the Zoom slider on this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as images from the front, frame and picture, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the sound-like correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web site which is accessible from this URL. the filter reproduced the known polford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the option Add film grain if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of movies, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film gradient effect applied to a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitides; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam, filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooth the smoothness or, seen from the other side, the focus.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out. this would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon labelling filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter engraving imprints your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give back your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter utilizes the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the picture into cells and make it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Dissharpen: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurred blurring: blurring the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness blurring: blurred the image by randomly displacement of the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the font in the image and wipe it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image editing to keep an area free from raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transformers Drew or Transformers mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you blow an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transform size change in menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Returns buttons are used exactly. any stallying for photo magnifying can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo bubbles at the bottom by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear enlargement magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cropping of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compose a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with cutting, use the button The Add-on button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After page ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting tool After page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it's always the same regardless of whether you're centimeter, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to cut to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup aid settings allow you to hide aids in order to better put your pictures together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious pitches are based on the principle of similarity. like the third gel, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle with similar harmonic triangles aligned on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition results in a look of the viewer along the lines of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that can be a line or different objects. this can be just there without directing the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equally angular triangles. diagonal to these lines can let a static object appear dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates an image in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">The values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the preset button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformers cropping out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the automatic cut function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option leaves the picture a bit after the turn. however, take note of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shading tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your image by using the Horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">A vertical and horizontal line is displayed to your help. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shading tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shearing produces twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformations cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that know. this is done based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can modify this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression methods for digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section, you will find more information on how to use modules with & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program dcraw, which is contained in & digikam. with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of rough formats that are edited by & digikam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often recorded in AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam; understand these formats and will not have any built-in possibilities to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digikam; use the movies to play movies to start playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are in & digikam; contain. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refocus, masking, & etc;. use a consistent dialog which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applied quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically split without duplicate. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the range below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">Vertically split. the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'ouse over 'style: shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and underexposure. the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image, from which you want to see the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are marked.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo characteristics: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphs Viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; graphene. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; programs included, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphs Viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; graphene. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of graph in & kate; calculates the graph and in & kgraphs;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open the graph in & kate; open in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; required for the representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. at first, if you run & kgraphs; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list Last opened files.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum comminution of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphs Viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later you can proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kgraphs;... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & kgraphs; instance, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph you come to a page should be fitted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one of several pages distributed graphene without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Upload page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphs; when a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can define a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphs; you can specify a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or specify to be asked at any start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which is usually displayed at one click in the main window with the & RMBN, opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphiviz; layout algorithms. the entries as they are described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerified graphene. it produces representations in accordance with the spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for ungerified graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Circo; algorithm orders the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphene file as parameter, and the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for non-executed graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; element to get further help to this item (if any).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module images provide tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry image, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">Then the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducredhe's default values in order to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is fully displayed as some settings might not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window for setting the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the menu item &gt; screen shot. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photombs:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other work areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot is made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and your family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of creating a token, so it is used for your authentication. it is, therefore, your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked on Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the export module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which indicates the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you need write permission. the module does not currently support other authorizations. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have set all the other options. using this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking the Ok button will start uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Familly you can set the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value specified at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The CIPI module gallery exporting is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographical location of the KIPI module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localisation provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsare can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears then. to make a possible correlation between time and localisation, you need to load a spurfile with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were taken back at the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracks are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one location for images, you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation options and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and press the correlations button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog has the coordinates from a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to place the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the card must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The selection allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshows</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth, which of course also affects file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if an error occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mashouts. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as standard in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size rises because no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please allow exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG coding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG encoders can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between each image you can insert a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're happy with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to re-set the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the picture transition is fixed below. a low value generates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep the extension pole possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you provide an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie using the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original part of it is: don't expect it to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG version can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same, and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, preserves all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the output button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. so use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion progresses.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resize resize in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred E-Mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you selected. click the Add Photos button to add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove pictures the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of the sending emails. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File menu File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG on image file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original exifdata are added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Advertising option makes it possible to display the file name of the images in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop. you can then manually leave with Esc. Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The temporal distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, every transition between the images will select a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen, you can see the current filename, position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has not currently been documented. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module Backstage is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can with & kphotoalbum; browse through these, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, there are now keywords in each group, so in persons, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">This selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined by yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not own suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify the image for each individual person to be displayed. to do this, you need to open the image editor window (described in more detail) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu. in the Adsichts window, you can customize the image for the appropriate person and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the label or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the entire date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here it is shown on pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try the same functionality, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the fast entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu item to start photoalbum; demo. after that, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you'd rather like to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name says, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The Timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). the following part of the user manual describes the in & photoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML Example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page. read more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without any description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. please note that all images are from a party. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of this page you can set up various resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so he can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the root folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can verify that they are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you set to output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a lot of time for it, you need to apply the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kin file, which can import others to your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to pictures. the advantage of saving all the pictures into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass that file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will not be found. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting pictures that you can view through File Exporting...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manually copy option to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy option to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal ZIP files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from File Import... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons belonging to the imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse pictures and look at: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps of (1) Setting up the information about your images, about (2) the browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images, but it has been expanded and today it is taking care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are saved and used it automatically for future starts. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu item Settings kPTalbum; setting up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & Kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual, you will find the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can invoke by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to process already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In this section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">View the settings that are available to you for setting up the member groups. with the selection list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left pane, there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared among each other together, it can be that the modules were tested with & photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures; demo database can be viewed either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, allowing it to be that some modules with & photoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between photoalbum and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & photoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must be & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category people, it will do so, so do so, so if you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can search your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information, since you do not yet have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to comment on each image with notes. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image has been taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, all pictures are shown by Jesper and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by assigning people, places and keywords. they are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always be able to use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to relocate the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, by the fact, that the names used are moved up to find and classify people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may still want to edit all the selected images and tag them with notes. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are under the thumbnail of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to select all of these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new superstructure or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place there to sort it to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you are currently sorting your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can drag and move the elements of the comment dialog by dragging and moving the elements that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are happy with the settings, click on the Options... that offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry image in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images in case you don't have a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button, and try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it is shown in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and either click the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, use pictures without saving you on the hard disk. of course, you must have saved the images somewhere, so & photoalbum; you can see the view of & photoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. however, for pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and back in. & kphotoalbum; does not support you until now, if you want to avoid inserting the affected CD. so, if you are angry about how to avoid confusion of your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those remaining that you want to make accessible to others and click on current view in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and select the menu entry Anything but current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set out which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so all the pictures you have locked will be hidden. if you want to see the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is not very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves those who are familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar with the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & photoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. this you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is in the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and discard them somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click on this, the browser will show you the appropriate entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and final image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus key, you can zoom in again The Plus button is zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed in. with the direct key sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can cancel this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the possibility to add images with characteristics while viewing them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in this picture you see a picture, where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">This can be seen in the browser. you can then use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after selecting the image. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to picture & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The chamois is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch to the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; to turn on the image, select painting from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Add menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will appear so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu or the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility Level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility Level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window ordering as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown to the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also save several window orders and switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a given view, drag the butt to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the tap to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the tap into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map-cards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the butt onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing at the top pointing arrow in the sidebar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of view. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View Window arrangement... save it. it displays a dialog by which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the View menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View Render Modi... the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the subsection subsection and enter the image detail for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling includes the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is splitted again and again, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold, then both pixels are computed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra pixels is calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivisions.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on jittering, change & povray; beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated radiations have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import an & Povray; scene, select File Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation of the displayed object. here you can find the path to your document and the version.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object bycatch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you check the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you check the bottom, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold values. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. the window orders section explains how you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Standard Window System Combination field: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all the error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points where you can change the target of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you click the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, although at the moment only as a finite final layer. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree closely, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom by clicking the + icon in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise one unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select a few in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview shows only a matte black material, because you still have to enter the pigments settings. therefore, always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called single color. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply execute this step as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, place a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection are already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good idea of what possibilities to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect. thus, the scene is processed pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, key shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to the default shortcuts for & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump seperately on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as components: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color map.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is using the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is usually used. this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure is the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece will be picked up. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions you might query more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume initiates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to allow the script to use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as an Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaustion amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts site of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & b; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer using bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer using bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this will lead to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the fault is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into meta information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-Sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only want a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decoding them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decoded the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>

<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First of all, the pieces are arranged according to the artist, and this is the best view of your collection. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playsite browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can get music from a entered URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press enter key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the back button for a long time until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by whitespace, search & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all the entries one, two and three.</seg>

<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -slightly looking for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order of the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or use the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task are more relevant, which of the enclosed programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line utility. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions which have all & kde; program common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () void format Dvd () void format .dvd () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name) void CreateFolder (QString Name, QString) void addUrl (KURL url, QString) void renameItem (QString path, QString _ NewName) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3binterface createDataCore CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; it can easily be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD) and many encoding that encoding these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default (these encoders need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (as a rule one per title) are compressed in the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you have to install lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders. however, all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install anything yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copy protection. avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While set-up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use to read out a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, about which you will stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. see the step by step example for more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the Settings tab in the encoding settings tab, the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already used file is selected for coding instead of a complete & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepages) for program events (such as read out the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting the encoder), you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides flac there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate differences are less important because both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is supplied free with most distributions but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo equipment. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and austeroids. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overstated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download the information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this is the author) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be inflicted damage. all information can be obtained anyway at a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb it may be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used for this; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoders and the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, predefined records for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the tab for setting the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about the encoders can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about the switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1's keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, since it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something into it using the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what should be repeated for each read-out & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, let's share the program with the freedb to load the & CD; to download the data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them every time you read a & CD; if you have found the right settings.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work, or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look into the file / etc / fstab will help to get a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here you don't have much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be shown as shown / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please select only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when missing keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically over the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down selector is simpler, will find a & CD; entry will immediately start reading the & CD; if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory or filename is changed with the directory order &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database in advance. however, this is more than 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two boxes need to be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load between the hosts is distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but since many firewalls run the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the 80 protocol, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to provide any & CD; transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to discard the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are saved. if the box is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual core or square or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each read out of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, we will describe how the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, has been set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is established, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained for a CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, then the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screen shot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search the FAQ section and answer the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already completed and the artist's name and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database using the 'unique' & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a composition with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments as individual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments which are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the Help button for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">For more information go to the homepage of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When you click the Select button to read the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is read out on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error when trying to work with a coding that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows you to read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration option to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions include a pre-compiled package, since & kaudiocreator. if you are reading this, you probably already have done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help such as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different settings. best read the step by step, for example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different learning flashcards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first start of the program without any clue as it should continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; if you want to add or change something useful, let it do. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop windows into the & kmid; this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the Item menu or press Space.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the tempo LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the Item, interrupts playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics of lyrics and others. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set anything manually. however, if you select an automatic text selection from the Settings menu, the Karaoke text is automatically selected, but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select the Text and Recon events entries from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played by the series. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the previous one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the Add add. it appears again in the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatically add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the sequence from the submenu dropdown sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next Song button, next song from the Item menu, or press the arrow button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button previous piece, entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & mid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events which the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, thus making a trumpet sound when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required compositions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be provided for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will specify how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and also leave a row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that need this instrument to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used above all to map sound to the percussions-channel. take a look at the included keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to replace the first and the second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForceWall option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio displays in which ratio Pitch-Bender occurrences are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which gets a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need a bit with & kmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. the MIDI Settings menu can be found in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard boards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">In agreement, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, do not enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have opened a & konqueror; windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or shrouded (if I want to play a MIDI file), only in the & konqueror; switch windows and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the midi files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much spare time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time. as a hobby, I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll get in touch with friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've always written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone for it. I want to stress that I only programming, because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the error that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thank you Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia, for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a soundcard, you need to compile it with MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the site The KDE website for new versions or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when there is information in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections from the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and stored playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. to click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and select next editing mode. by clipping a sub-group only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select the same playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format needs to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starting does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of start animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; / lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / mmgt; & KMPlayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is one tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; this must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is always taken for a given mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, use the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding must be found out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource, vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is a user root after the device is plugged. it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / cdrom will appear on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection areas should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of joint elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Selection field More is for inserting articles such as keywords, nodes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, a picture or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a defined term (select a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name Graph will be used for defining the font size. you can specify the font width for the main text, the joints, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the menu or the quick build of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; performs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, logging in should be sought after the errors. when using quick construction, it should be started & eyepiece; if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font height 12 will be created and only a few bags should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows to add the change of the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, it may be added to certain fonts, grease, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid as long as it is closed with\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed italically with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin-rate} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; markup language is presented, a step-by-step guide is now followed for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, you should make a few adjustments for the better readability of the document. for this, there should be a quote, a few passages in bold and italics, and a poem to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the case of an internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a volume-dependent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different kinds of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed with file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file has been created from the & latex; source code, the transformation into selected other formats can begin by means of buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search allows the direct jump from the editor to the attached position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binding files. to do this, you just need to set up Modern with Settings... Building up tools.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the advance search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source code and clicked on predestination search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then executed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; file by & kile; opened and bound to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & Okular; can be specified as text editor (Settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using Quick-Construction of the & DVI; viewers do not open, an error may occur. if an error is present, this will be displayed in the log-in file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the source code in the source code. in the editor, the popup can be used in the source code. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, click on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can be either written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-level users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings may be replaced with other data (such as name or character encoding).</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are being replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps have to be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the default one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu directly from & box; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to learn its options, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start working with the editor of & kate directly by reading the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical and latex; command reference, which can be called on the menu help LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a clicked Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the & latex differ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include additional marks within the text. this is a custom type of bookmarks within the text. the MenÃ ¼ or Edit Highmarks or the corresponding key can also be highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile;. although & kate; already offers excellent opportunities, have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & kicks; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). with a paragraph not a text is meant with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning closes with tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & box; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word from the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete part of the document, of course, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description for editing select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile provides; for further instructions under Edit environment for a more balanced simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or inside the command\\ begin {surround}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested ambient commands, the above overview can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those of Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the shrink sleeve.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the shrink-closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the loosen clip of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of nested groups braces, the above overview can quickly be lost. this command includes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as a liquid. for the purpose-bringing implementation is used in & kile; the character is used for two simple suits. also for the end of the application, the character is used. & Kile; knows this case and completes two closing suits for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up in the Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in custom settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key, & Kile; an intelligent line switch. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close a table environment, close & tilt the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent newline.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and thereby arrange all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & Kile; tries to enable this. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tab in the next line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it has been added in & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is started using the command\\ begin {Environment} & Kile; automatically add command\\ end {Environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the return key the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to enlarge the list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are, of course, removed when selecting a command. alternatively, it can be added by & Kile, so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jumps is possible and the selected parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; set up... Kile; can make settings on these lists. it can be selected different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands, as well as walls of common language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The mode command mode is not useful for executing environments. it must always have a few letters with\\ begin to be entered, and the execution mode calls for a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kicks; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full finish mode over the menu full environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically added to the environment and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kicks; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Box; Set up... Kile; Enable can make settings to these lists. this mode uses the complete list of state-of-the-art modes for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of queries that are immediately replaced by more expensive strings. the lists can be set up in the Settings box... Kile can be fully implemented. as an example of a list box, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word assignment mode added to the Edit menu or the key Ctrl + Alt space key, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Big payment processors are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many documents are written more than once in a document. with this, & Kile provides for all already written documents.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Settings... Kile can be completely destroyed. here you can also set the threshold for displaying the full damage.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in groups in the creation compiling, create and create view.</seg>

<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, its file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already tagged in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply clicked. if not, delete the tick on current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file well-formed is, click the well-formed check selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">For the use of a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (Internal), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the definition URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; Schema as well as for the Relax NG check is the specification of the definition URI; in file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has a XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus; already selected, then just let the current file be selected. if not, remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have named, and the file is usually stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the file in & quantaplus. the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or KPart, we start with the menu plug-in Edit. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -Element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the Setze tab. the currently selected member (their identification) appears bold after which they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An EMail will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. addressing can be a team or sub-project leader. see how to set up such conductors.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the comment entries from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword followed in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the recruited nickname of the team member, role plays a role in the project resulting from the following possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around brackets and: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for script and formatting languages, which is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible through the Settings menu. here, only above & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta setting. this dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car completion, can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / Lumpy of Tags: capitalization of automatically inserted tags. normal wholesale / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagonal files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">"" "large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal" "" "lower case" "" "means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagonal files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this is immediately added to the tag.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Automatically closing non-optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end tag: when enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic insertion of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: encoding of newly created or otherwise than file-open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is omitted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; create backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor pane or in one's own view (or documentation in a cardboard box), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset window settings to default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL and the source code view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the Parser and the Structure Tree, which represents the picture of the Parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the Structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Tree Configuration area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifout abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third side, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, on the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Read Only" "" "mode: check if the plugin is denied loading. only-read-parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testing & quantaplus; if the inserted information is correct, then it is possible to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. (3) Debugger has been adjusted as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept was implemented which allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. normally appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugger's requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to run a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution continues. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will start.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where it is possible to clean up in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a front end and a KPart of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can & quantaplus; adjust to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; capabilities like car completion and hubs. their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folder includes two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders are handy, symbolic key of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tag XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus. file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool lists allow quick inserting tags into a document without any risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but a folder. they contain only file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder name the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used it is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a just-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current day.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause leg breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently the check is done only when loading the tag XML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; superload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the designated settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh.This is how to find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be substituted with the PID of the current and quantaplus; process. if of & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input by & quantaplus. in the input field, input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, to the default output, can be specified by setting the output selector output to the default output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable" "" "Edit tag" "" "dialog if available so that an input while using the action is possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered less, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -Tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar button to set the toolbar settings. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick access to the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by quoting all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the correct folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its file name (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you must search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you must create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second one we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html tag 2 = tag _ html tag 3 = tag 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP; documentation for something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit to the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of concreted context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an e-mail sent menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing. to make an online contribution, we recommend to sign the resources, for which there is a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar tool bar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagging format. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination Directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and complete these concepts, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to everyone who uses & quantaplus. using actions is all that is selected as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in a global tree that can then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction views, the tab drivers with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other, or all cardboard triggering, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, springing to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor pane to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing of the tags under the mouse pointer, or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is used as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of the editor window, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The BaumanPlans (QIT;) make it possible to navigate in information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with tab drivers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global Templates are always available, local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands will open in relation to the navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree-views. with it, you can change attributes and namespaces. the system-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be reached using useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This critic displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other save and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the site of the source script; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus. summarized already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus, for that the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers, what has someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; framework not only this is all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffold Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special character to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; Description which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Toggles the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful when your & PHP script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and turning of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter gets activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents are grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project is managed. see chapter & quantaplus; projects will explain the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by settings actions... added. toolbar buttons are saved using toolbars toolbar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; team for the toolbar at the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that has made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and if there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu item in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of toolbar until this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on them. click on an activated plugins deactivated it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode that matches the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate help according to the surroundings of the mouse pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically, e.g. after filling out the project name. all these paths and author information fields can be set up later with Shift; F7 project project properties are set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, the file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can select an exact selection according to your own manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the tick, clinging from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. in the menu with Project Properties, these settings can be uploaded to the Profile tab in the Profile window or with the Shift key shortcut; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as Project Folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>

<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow one can disable event actions and add, modify or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens and quantaplus; the last project that was open. you cannot influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or icon project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders also behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu which can be activated with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Programming. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the record store option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this doesn't have to be changed unless the network administrator doesn't run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus, to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbar buttons are available in & quantaplus; the best way to customize the toolbar. use and add are different. adding toolbars is handled in the addition of toolbars at the bottom of the page.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and icons can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be removed, the toolbar can be rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified, what actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action is displayed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and specify Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets, and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a basic file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or associate existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you present for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can include any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using intg src = / src / url. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in corresponding subfolders. you can create a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the document based on a template, but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As templates save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As templates store select as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can predefine headers and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; create, insert or associate files with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop down selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parent attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set in such a way, it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a regular folder the blah would appear with something like text-building block. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to pre-set or set text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and, by copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers, can already furnish a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor that can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; Editor and the second pane splits the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when needed, in which the changes made in the VPL; Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously, and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small gap for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose the document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the Documentation dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows the change of content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a minor nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this feature turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more anger if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Follic2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 -o destination folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows the manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup knob opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparisons / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a reference window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every information line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, allow the mouse to rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red for that. (color for conflict in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is shown dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info row with the output output:, the filename and [changed] if you edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merging already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current pane and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">This text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting sources ignoring numbers or ignoring ignores C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters as well.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly navigated with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw also can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (preset is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merging section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture) or the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if it is checked, it is automatically copied to the clipboard and copying manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could thus accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline\\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed logically. in these systems, the button presets automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard, copying manually into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a newline\ '\' at the end of one line, while others may look identical in the side-to-side comparison, although they are different. if this option is checked, this option will be disabled. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is passed on.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (preset is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. see for details see documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must exit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding, a brief reference appears, which is the local code. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window side by side or overlapping each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. merging the merging menu will also work if you just compare two files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessor command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give users greater flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for line comparison to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all these are followed by a $\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so almost erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you may also use something else, such as perl -p -e's / RegExp / Create / SCHALTER. However, perl needs some details different. where used\\ (and\\), perl only needs (and) without the '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm predicts.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in one folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of individual files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folders is complete shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on + / - or double-clicking on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of any problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be the same if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. at folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronizes directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees only B visible as visible file name for the output file; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged, and the option New file instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file will be processed after the other. you status column shows skill when merging was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected for Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merging actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, C is used as destination in the Three folder merge mode, B is chosen as target and used when synchronizing A and / or B as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the -menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge action, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options passing, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merge window opens (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, start / continue / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3 puts an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you wish to try another action for the entry, or to solve the problem in a different way before you merge with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again during the later compilation. even if merging is skipped or not saved, these entries are considered done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?' (e.g. * .cpp; * .h).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many auto-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a predefined point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links are treated like normal folders and checked recursively. (note that & kdiff3 does not check for possible recursions.) This option is turned off to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and substantially slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare just the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">There is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date is lost. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the new file, it is suggested as an action. (this is considered uncertain because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder merge. to do this, the status will be set to be completed and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory again: directory Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive to a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative undet. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters need to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished as to whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select Add In KDEVELOP from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart, it takes & kdiff3; then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can perform together like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or let him go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the row is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src appears; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes under http: / / kdiffs.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install, on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should have no problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must re-read the folder after changes to these options with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">When you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled in default. underfarewells in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, quit them or move them. this works in both desktop and multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; when clicked, the context menu has only the two entries pager... and exit. if however, click on an application within & Kpager; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimum, Maximize, On Desktop and End. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names are provided with Ordinary Figures, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">The window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; Main Window can be specified: classic leaves & Kpager; in an 2xN grid appear, as well known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual working surfaces in horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for the representation sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right mouse button within & Kpager; and subsequent selection of switch settings... allows the dialog box to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can not be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen loupe. you can use & Kmag; a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairments. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. below is a magnified area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & Kmag; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the mouse pointer's environment at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor position. please note that & Kmag; currently not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; key, or the & MMB; use, you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the drop-down window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the display. stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouseclick as soon as the mouse-cursor is waiting for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those with mouse click pains. furthermore, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that occurs while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse pain. unfortunately, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can pull the pull with pressed mouse button. the intelligent delay requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be petrified at the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool, a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If smart postpone is switched on, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it leaves the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports mouse shift click. if this feature activates, generates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it is started & kmousetool; at any start by & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use a mousetool, first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent delay should be switched off at first. if you then have used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the intelligent delay.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, it means that & kmousetool will stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. by doing so, the status of & kmousetool is reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, place the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy and paste text into the clipboard or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you are just starting & kmousetool; instead, mark the text as follows: enter a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this is used every time & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shutter speed starts when smart moves. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouseclick.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window must be installed; this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouseclick is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor is blindfolded. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to play.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag-drop to start before the mouse button is left. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compress, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including packages kdelibs and the development files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdechs or downloaded the tarball created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; first check if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the configuration of speech dispensers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual phrases. the user can return, repeat, pause or cancel propositional phrases or sets.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it can be used, otherwise automatically the best suitable speaker is selected. if you want to know more about how & ktts; select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the Add-In Ticket to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the card board speaker setup will be displayed. for example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices, the & ktts; known, this setting is done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you set volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulators and these are displayed gray, the voice selected by you does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to load because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet installed a speaker (or forgot to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed in kttsmgr. otherwise, only the icon of ktmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktsmgr does not work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the job, the number of sentences and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes to the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will become a symbol in the system segment. click on this icon to view the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must figure out which device works with you. in doubt, select Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions, which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning stops the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless, welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, it adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text jobs. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and screen readers if they are interrupted by sending a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktts; read the Notify news, start kttsmgr and click on notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable reading & kde. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played is from & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentioned your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored by & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired speaker. default selects the speaker, which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card board. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application, it is executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as a last option, the action will be carried out which is set under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The All Notifications for the Application Standard (all other events may not be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the default notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the notification settings to a file. use the Load button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events are merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone (British) voice as this is the default voice that the festival uses in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs do not divide text into individual sentences. this allows & ktys to start reading faster, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. this allows you to skip or stop orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set of set limits. at the first start of & ktts, a set of set limits is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set limits, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the speakers selection and enter text for reading. check the list of speakers, change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker has changed. you must of course have more than one speaker setup, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the carton card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set level recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be disabled, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for set-ups and add a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab sign are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set-set filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set of set filters from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"" "on the" "" "Karteikarte" "" "voice selection, you can override the language settings for the application. the card card is displayed when you select" ""</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the upper one on the card board). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a built-in speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker selector and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is written for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number (without the order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get any tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and & ktts; it was finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, you may install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts with ALSA can occur which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but ttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktmd / festivalint / vocals. as a guide, please send a patch to the developers together with the URL you found.</seg>
<seg id="2751">At the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be sox installed and accessible via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card card for speaking setup. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion from & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; - after-SSML reforming filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktys; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file formats into Saber-Tags for converting SSML. the same also applies to the VOICE-tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I added an own string replacement filter and now I can go in & ktts; no more replacements left or backward. on the cartesplanter orders is shown, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question marks, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for set limits.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts; you can call the st-register command. (HTTP: / / gstream.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system is also included, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; freezes when you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be invoked by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter will be displayed; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the choice is offered. it is the platform from the list that best suits your distribution and release. when setting the setting, the definition can be made permanently. when you start setting the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, click the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to be edited in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be done at the same time. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be used without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface at boot time. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off on demand. switching on an outdated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled, depending on your needs. turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host IP address in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain specification by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only can understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine for namespouting part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and ascending or herring in the list with the buttons Hindi or herrings in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be displayed to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select an entry from the group calculator and click the Edit button. the Edit dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of name-known hosts describes the hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list includes some known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostakos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to Edit Your Computer will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings module are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command is set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile it. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second one is discussed all by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section does not replace any further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; the network administrator is the contact person who is running a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.01eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if another content is found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the capability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be included by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; remembers the band and reads the prestressing information of the band. detects & kdat; not the pre-tensioner on the band, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the template, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, first the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be thrown out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not conform to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive requires that a tape can be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the band. floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity & kdat, proceed with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog, you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test is started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the verification, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process is started, the Settings dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the index.html file on the basis of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup job:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up Settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape machine.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option turned on, tries & kdat; to lock the ejection on tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when the connection is removed, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option from floppy disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; the hardware-calibrated block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features that can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. will not show you this, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the directory / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter for a selected criteria or string. the list of log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed that match the selected filter. in the default setting, the drop-down field contains the All. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column. in the protocol file system log, select the process column, and then enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of level critic. the color representation of protocol lines can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly becomes the standard for monitoring program start-up when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further down to historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start when moving the system or switching to another run level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default RunLevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something messed up then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to any of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script ends with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way of setting up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. moreover, I could have a user-run level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer device is simple to avoid telling trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six runner-levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new range. in order to only copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert in the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sortiernumnumber of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run level, move it to the clipboard with cut-out (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runner-level (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the port number or the name of an entry, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; to run under RunLevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Customization of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two map cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card management card password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the quota user / quota group file on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are in KB size:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system file system</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card group informs about the group dependencies of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
