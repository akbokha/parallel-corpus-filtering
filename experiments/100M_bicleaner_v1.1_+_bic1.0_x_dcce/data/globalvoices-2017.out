although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceedingly great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and pursued his sport .
indeed , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and declares publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in stark contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp broke his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either share his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note D . ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups , &quot; white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , meaning the big Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ anist , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America that promises and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ted the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who isn &apos;t like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s country now , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
that the music that is played in both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music gang ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its use of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare ray of hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le and play the trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , is made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
country fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ns , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ ap@@ tise one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , recalls . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ under@@ ing the stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are , in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the Premier had exp@@ elled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , which circul@@ ated information between individual countries , actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable at the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details found or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas . such susp@@ icious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load his captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal opinion .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among others , actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , f@@ antasi@@ es of f@@ antasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole now tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be ordered by satellites .
that &apos;s why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Sea Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew Char@@ itable trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that previously f@@ ished without licence and hardly had to expect consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now reported a 33 % increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets there on board , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With certainty , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country of Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ laim@@ ing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela appear to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ position of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela refused the opposition to a referendum for im@@ pe@@ achment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went to the void by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Te@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the order of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country is continually wor@@ sen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the reluc@@ t@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum on minist@@ erial change was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to continue the process against the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was to continue the blocking of the referendum for the removal of the office .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is far from Venezuela : dawn National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration within the framework of the Action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .

on Twitter , pictures that tell about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national guards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round that forms the level of repression a day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a conc@@ ession procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado assert that 1 % of sign@@ atures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your minist@@ erial activity !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view made little effort against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ tended to refrain from tac@@ kling critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or going shopping .

this is an adap@@ table version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were examined .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a maid .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ist . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to military base
when my dad started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP .
be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and then I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Labor Party .
therefore he prohibited me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a ga@@ it .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ at that time the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me under a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a song tor@@ tured on people .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ der .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I became aware that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to figures of survivors of the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina were sentenced to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look on the map , you can see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war @-@ war is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges , which one takes on an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is ste@@ aling .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criminal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the dead is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why leave the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why leave their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last disgu@@ sting act you can do to a man .
my father told me that when democracy was re @-@ imported , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even part of the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ ised and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , show me now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I received the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally testified against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims end of August .
43 The op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases sentenced to prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 18@@ 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Decision : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was taken together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship said :
the process took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located to establish a Memorial , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto in which you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ erable translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word was given to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with evil back than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
elabor@@ ation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , a daily newspaper in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ ori@@ sts involved in accidents across the country is a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 cases .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents in total has decreased , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the name @-@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo &apos;s website , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently are against older drivers :
Yahoo &apos;s article on translation errors , among others , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So incorrect is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
in this way , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who don &apos;t have foreign employees , still make translations fir@@ s@@ th@@ . then the Japanese employee , whose English language skills are assessed as the best , is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the distorted and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ ors on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ position@@ ist groups who oppose Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was tied and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission on Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ Elec@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly is transferring its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains .
if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS barrier : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked canal , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls are slaves to receive training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ tically child as a child . she now visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness testim@@ onies of other crimes , just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from university she went back to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become of something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ tically , one den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ tiz@@ i - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which cri@@ es cri@@ tically to the cri@@ tiz@@ an guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she should complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience only a few years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy blows . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military house Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra took a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there was &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows than children are registered , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ tiz@@ ers are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik in which her father worked , had to bank@@ rupt the bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work .
their brothers now had to work all and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stopped at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days for example , she puri@@ fied the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and disinf@@ ects the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
at some evenings , the owner of the household , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , forced to stand next to him , and to read the editorial in opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone listening while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to cri@@ tiz@@ ers when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .

society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please sign in .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ f@@ teen girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the display again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .

in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were subjected to slavery ) , with which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ eight Egyptian MPs have recently approved a draft law on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to use citizens with permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and personal ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could ent@@ ail a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any use that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on the users . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices said :
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly controlling physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y Par@@ liam@@ entary Com@@ miss@@ ar proposed a crime against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest against protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature guard protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in Iraq marked by war

this contribution from To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights researcher H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which swe@@ eps through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ op@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish eco @-@ system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian @-@ le@@ op@@ ard really is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza collap@@ ses in sheer pleasure .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region are set up .

in early March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma fired the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s north @-@ east , experiencing both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be evacu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coast towns out of the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has still experienced a nuclear accident , and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authorities as well as survey results of the victims themselves .
housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( in the city of the city of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the largest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light .
nevertheless , one still tries to reloc@@ ate six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated from home accommodation ( in the case of the use of a cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final substitute houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there still lived 36@@ 0,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ees hau@@ led to housing shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led to final homes .
the number here is 34 percent for I@@ w@@ ate .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have res@@ um@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have greatly affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe , almost half of the coastal population , it feels more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ated ones . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her receiving has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
how it is to those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witn@@ essing the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement buildings .
at the end of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees , still living in Beh@@ el@@ ef@@ arri@@ hausen , are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia struck him with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied Social Sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a traum@@ atic brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officer in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page , &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network in which one sees Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and rus@@ hed to him shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also reflected in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian real rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit , after he was attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stroke .
police raid bars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police intervention against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber stor@@ eys and tear gas .
the member of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from demonstr@@ ators on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their song pages .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window @-@ window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
you have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the villages in Cuba that have been forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alization
with the introduction of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba included doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able harvest of sugar on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some ex@@ changing the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an of soldiers who wake up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members closely to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first shot of the month , the first letters began to come .
it was a question of officially written documents that would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve of any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was someone who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he assures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
against his will , he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working de@@ generating set has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to reck@@ on it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were used to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to R@@ ente for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter .

the workshop will make it possible for young participants to explore topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this video of the school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yo@@ o in the territory of the first nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Highway of tears &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey the importance of obtaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation added , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group , who gave them a stan@@ he in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and as do our youth .
this is how they can do what the Creator has decre@@ ed .
in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ame ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( to share with you ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are placed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ) of any food served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to making these plastic dishes .
in the Tog@@ ab@@ ashi district of Tog@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually so that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y mobile phones and other gad@@ gets today .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in sale : new ones decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ers fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more elaborate .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
also this part was made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some cell phone supports and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tizing way to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dies ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video will give you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ses and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every dead body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug trade &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs each weekend for his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who only one day lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves for the task which we have set before us to go and look for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or regard it as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they mock those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ kon@@ kt &quot; as a family with threats had been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals put money on their business for month , until they had not only destroyed the business but also torn off their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes away , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ent Generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and the government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the Nar@@ co@@ data journ@@ alism project whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or to expose fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for many years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker collap@@ sed .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball , which wrapped dozens of houses , including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the football world champion@@ ships .
houses burned and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows numbers of char@@ ted bodies that are str@@ ung along the ground while individuals look at them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photo was listed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be displayed on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a had been a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was wrong@@ ly shown as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ sely reflect the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning warning published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee are pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image of the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also mistakenly attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s statement , but had not related the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ ples go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3rd May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing mas@@ h of private pages , social media platforms and joint as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed incorrect reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , based on what side they were published . by doing so , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been linked to each other ) several examples can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange lands point to pages or servers where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

true or false ? ) .
one side , which makes ru@@ mo@@ urs rise , asked that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the Fal@@ se message but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian portion of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly no sites such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster have seen this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article draws attention to the continuing poverty of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article of Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo ; Indian Express article had not included in the time of publication of our article .

the most shock@@ ing photo you have ever seen ! ) .
this page used the image as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a gre@@ ek fac@@ tual check @-@ page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of theology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about N@@ asi@@ m news agency and illustr@@ ating the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old@@ town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this message on his site to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo became an evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet which expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted to deli@@ mit as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a list of what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos taken by international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings on Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judge , which has been published exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors , who run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other sources ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ailed ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the moment of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this 2014 article about students who have been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted news site An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ elling more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
the organisation of the mission@@ aries and father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves from the embassy in which the image was taken from the DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye accounts for other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ understanding and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dissemination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equ@@ ated to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded of the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is the concern that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive .
however , any examination of wrong attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses under CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. uns@@ ett@@ able ) stri@@ ves to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or at all not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ me@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved around you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rück language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after getting ang@@ ri@@ ly in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite destinations here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri Lanka disaster centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and slu@@ dge win@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the down@@ tro@@ dden water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the region around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ i@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ Center is informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoch@@ wasser@@ hilfe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat ret@@ ali@@ ation actions for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need bring security and help support measures .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in you my four years old daughter ; she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the burning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head cloth high , bound from an American flag , others clas@@ h slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in its conception .
they ent@@ ailed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit like me , are ent@@ ailed .
to be reli@@ ed on
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you think of when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western concept religion Rum@@ i was er@@ ased as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been col@@ oni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has so deeply and in@@ correctly occupied our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh men and children are aimed at tim@@ us@@ hing attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong to
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed utterly to grasp the scar@@ city of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ based Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were free Muslims and Americans .
but am I now free Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or carrying out my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ d@@ ment machine with back@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information , which have tam@@ pered with our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the head of a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it interfer@@ es with our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surge that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
it would see the ritual of the evening with my daughter if I held it in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters eventually posed in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to her sisters is the image of my mother@@ ly mother with her sisters ; as they have decades ago a contest of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a people who - over centuries - have been colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire &quot; which has established a company with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dis @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my fellow grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , N@@ ana J@@ aan bol@@ ted to his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all the way down to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ an sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time since he was the first mos@@ que in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion goes deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread across every continent beyond the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy enters the United States and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate with others .
the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registr@@ atures that have begun with President Bush and have been wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that borders its borders towards people from just countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely sights Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs that we throw off to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically un@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we need to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going back decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous images we ste@@ er in our news editorial offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ er Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to propag@@ ate Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts that existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet been given them ; now they dominate big areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public show , were themselves scientists of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , who feeds chocolate cake while he has already broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird , the conf@@ is@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS lies not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has performed events since 2015 , the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first translate their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation are leading to the audience .
they evoke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou conve@@ ys the opportunity to explain the habits of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the nav@@ el from the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his fi@@ del@@ ity , John Ny@@ entre@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were with me all the time !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt from the USA
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march commen@@ ced at the gr@@ ass@@ land of Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano de la Deu@@ da ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial check and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be dangerous to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of ess@@ ays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information on his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that pus@@ hes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken away from his cell in A@@ dra on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , its place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at present the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tian &apos;s cultural prototypes was more than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything in order to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural legacy of Syria but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
so far , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with it , dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in detention .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology for me . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
they smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I put in every detail of your voice and words
that I wear with passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I let another piece of my soul be with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes away , my soul
during the period
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been det@@ ained in prison according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope that we have to do for the last time .
Mozambique : President condem@@ ns corruption on previous post due to corruption
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ odo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defend@@ ants for the in@@ stig@@ ation of 54 million me@@ tics ( some 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecutor &apos;s Office of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not know the action well .
in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards for the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that even the company should have a disciplinary approach against the offen@@ ders .
however , the company seems to be silent and does not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case to be &quot; disgu@@ sted &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had served .
he could consider paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
bitter@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing morality and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and inci@@ dental speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he is inde@@ b@@ ted to mon@@ ies , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ hym@@ nal _ Raf@@ ik , 12 . may 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo by the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( German : @ truth ) states that crime in Mozambique pays off :

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the use of the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call out hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about its use were cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , &apos; cal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ ary hair &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question @-@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression much , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ung believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you &apos;re writing on fac@@ tual .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by examining the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts by telling his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author divided his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities .
it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; stool &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ orship has provided a lot of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and look at an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have risen .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the balancing act of hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as this does not mean age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical center authorities confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media mo@@ tions aimed to aboli@@ sh child marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without a doubt they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the cri@@ tique of the chil@@ dr@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should think about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this seemingly un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it .
after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for the chil@@ dr@@ ens were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is wearing a minist@@ erial commission in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of things , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s mind was , it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ acious news !
the Act has been resolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ proof age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of religious affili@@ ation .
the proposal for am@@ ending marriage was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were admitted have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the gu@@ ise of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take out judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to dissolve his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that can only provoke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used against them , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ iled men that are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they fail .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many techni@@ qu@@ ated Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or difficult .
the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the messages ( via the bar@@ ring of Wikipedia ) , we set out to place sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia in Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I was just resting at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan al Qaeda lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river D@@ am is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to sn@@ out pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ k appeared . he immediately res@@ ig@@ ns , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . until 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband , and fear of the consequences , they should desp@@ ise the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto , from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a , was convic@@ ted by a floo@@ d@@ light and rejected by her family and the village community after calling a married relatives with names .
the tradition of calling their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have much less assignment to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign promoted by the Association of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the bann@@ ing of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected individuals , and manages this club .
she reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion rounds tra@@ ded women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
to not pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands al@@ oud , is a custom that they all du@@ ly maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the crus@@ hing of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only ch@@ ich@@ ing before him , and another decided to release the entire st@@ un@@ ned fru@@ stration of him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put on the women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red spot if he did it .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to bear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine cure , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , mor@@ als related to the sar@@ is and much more , rough Roh@@ ini put their own couple of cur@@ d@@ ta in a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done only small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including myself , make it , but only when they are alone and not other members of the family .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothing - are at the end of a heavily navig@@ able river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 , this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was about to share with the city &apos;s Twitter trend ( Beat@@ les Mem@@ orials Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend with many fans ex@@ changing memories and sharing their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Mem@@ orials Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Kit@@ sch of Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in a market @-@ oriented manner , like this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day will be gone today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for ab@@ u@@ sive purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia declared to the BBC .
it is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are destination of ritual attacks , warned the Mozambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , and this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ass@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces :
I M@@ UST BE a Land in which people would have shame to walk on the street , as if the teachers would be ashamed to do their bread , a country in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased that aim to gain rapid riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ang@@ ler , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in extending public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels St@@ ay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay homage to the creativity of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web @-@ movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have campaig@@ ned for their release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested or enforced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians came to death in custody , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after having participated in the draft Charter of 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China continues to permit calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad a treatment abroad .
Norway and the United Kingdom
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the crew of the salmon to China , because the exports had largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union and the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to aboli@@ sh all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message requested the Chinese authorities to free not only Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US embassy reloc@@ ated a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with the fact that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in the Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u receives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Peking of news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex for Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the USA
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u At@@ tor@@ ney previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and liber@@ ating the rights of these rights .
France and the United Kingdom
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry ur@@ ges China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news station France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will finally receive it .
Taiwan and the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of mainland issues in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called for China to allow the impot@@ ent intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Bran@@ ch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compare Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he tar@@ nished the related questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
as An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire record of the conference , so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore should be so un@@ even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement as leader of an adol@@ escent generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a wrong speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service ? do they defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay back our Prime Minister Bill ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine is ten@@ ding to affir@@ m that Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked its editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series with which ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most in Japan reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differenti@@ ate us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves to their luggage in order to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently we say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country of ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d change me to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be idle - like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odic Thai j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend is doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not specifically political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military domination of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared by 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian paragraph 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; amend@@ ment &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also set up , the online content monitored and persons accused of having been slan@@ dered by the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict attitude towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payments .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ los are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , H@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mostly Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , after barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ z@@ ha@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were communal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ ka ch@@ ow@@ ka houses one or two families can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ ou@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holidays are , we visit ourselves .
but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; you said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get used to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration headquarters in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mines .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she says it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation begins to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ elled buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood that cares for in@@ def@@ ences in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates , people come in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry out : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also have been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ch@@ ee ) poses with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the way , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companions Michel@@ et lived before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ening , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he responds smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is police officer and has found out that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that is why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , while others also open their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a sole educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers always consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she fli@@ rts with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets that she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly while she introduces her to me .

the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi gave a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message is said to prevent the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police inspec@@ ting the residents random@@ ly if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it may be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices designed for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest @-@ awakening technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( now available ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which highlights that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ or &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ence , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are alone in a place where all important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to her name .
one who has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow any metaph@@ ors .
but if reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the spectacle , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of disaster . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
during a peaceful protest , five young people were ri@@ pped out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations with full and full .
at such a moment , you become aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you trust what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father right away with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the single cells .
I conc@@ eive of all details before I enter the room .
otherwise they have all@@ otted to me a bigger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and can put me right away , without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ef@@ ree &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all rep@@ lies deny its existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ rog@@ ated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ored in the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from far away I still hear them sh@@ out &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es catch , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was aired : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house here , which is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co @-@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet with Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important things with your life than join these ro@@ dents and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to not answering .
I really can &apos;t say more exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a kind chat for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the loving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es were not satisfied yet , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I ceased to cry out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t like it , which is why he picked him next to an electrically charged rod .
current flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean with you , Ar@@ sh@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , occasionally also to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ey@@ men ( for example : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam on a burning hot young day .
basically speaking the lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in public during Ram@@ adan in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior Jordan has cancelled the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert hall .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which question the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflected in an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b restored traditional gender norms by em@@ ailing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Ehren@@ mor@@ de reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrest in@@ definitely in prison &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee from the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , later to note that his comments were torn from context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b says : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
a short time ago , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service arrested several former government decre@@ es and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers &apos; Association , stating that they have been critical of the problems linked to deep @-@ rooted corruption in social media .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the aid of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , stre@@ at@@ uni@@ tions and artificial kind of driven demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes .
until it is far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will further ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the solid trol@@ leys , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a super view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition dedicated to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid carri@@ ages are to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

seldom external appearance and personal care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these la@@ vis@@ h hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dressing arts instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to children we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : letters of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to offer affection to people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this was precisely the question of the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la cat@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sign@@ atory of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , who had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian collabor@@ ated and had to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who will then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he agreed to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the scope of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept orders from their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL gar@@ net was lying , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , and was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC argued the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state came to an end to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former comb@@ at@@ ants replied to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
in our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is related to the LG@@ BT@@ Q community &apos;s LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not yet emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her and why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunting on Sab@@ rina was opened .
in the last analysis , fear@@ ing for her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to retrieve a couple of shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honour the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had got all along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two flu@@ kes in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which health @-@ wing were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they said absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I hadn &apos;t changed my gender that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked about my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my mother it became too much and she lay a rope around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a license plate with 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , which is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I carry still in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male shape .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed home ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have been possible for these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the grave !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , bore tube @-@ jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never curved me even a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children , when people make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped up the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but above all on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : which job are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t tolerate a cent for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I stum@@ bled away places of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to fool you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys at them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all about it - I just know that I am I myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran that is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video viol@@ ated on YouTube kept the moments when he lit up himself .
some people quickly made it clear to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Haw@@ k M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed this month .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family pat@@ ernal who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a major part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the rich@@ est and most valuable crops for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically rejected the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in Ah@@ ra@@ z is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination : &quot; &quot; &quot;
because officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired , as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ial &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex continues throughout the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin colour , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists agree to silence .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind which refer both to sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a terrible and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ari@@ anism : claims to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alization after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be published here again as part of a content sharing agreement .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ eph@@ ro@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ wife , who had been violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship there had been some time and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to ill @-@ treatment , the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later the second woman retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women do not even provide ads , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities .
contents 1 blows and statistics 2 In@@ visible ill @-@ acts and a legal system that is not subordin@@ ate to 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation beats and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads of domestic violence took place at the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came here as well .
in the displays 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ stries Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; for each woman , who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for any woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible acts and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . she should regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most noticeable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of ill @-@ treatment had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ o@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign promoted by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ ici@@ d to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win MEPs for the law , which feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years &quot; imprisonment .
the original bill had provided most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply wish to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to make such a long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions on the changes are dealt with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a year of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the Court but were later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public liber@@ ties , freedom of the press , and to torture , intim@@ id@@ ate and incar@@ cer@@ ate independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on Jud@@ ge of the Supreme Court in Oman in order to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page from Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS arrested the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information gave the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of &quot; public order , mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Korean ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , one year of professional ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit of 5000 om@@ bian gi@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i during a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month jail term in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is serving his imprisonment .
the Court of Appe@@ al also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Korean government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again asked the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peac@@ efully , supports and provides them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the phar@@ ma companies is a big problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the use of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that needs to change , otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being makers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where does the financing and support come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system means that magazines can only be made available for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also restric@@ ts the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions to environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ch@@ ewed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on always breeds salad , but it needs longer since its work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , nobody can breed a new sort of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material which is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ breaks in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .
photo : NASA
it is no coincidence that this name sounds so as if the movement originated from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed produced by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others , as opposed to patent seeds and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , the executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , thereby making it usable for plant breeders either not at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are bred so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to those that thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far less predictable .
Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ aker , C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
such protection therefore in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , it promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , and certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a whole , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a species also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow naturally her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , who breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exact opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are small ) patents , most smaller seed companies can survive , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is also considered to be more innovative breeders because of the prevention of plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; for 20 years , he is protected from competition with a patent , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be leading the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding program , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is an open source seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agreement agrees on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
one explanation is , however , not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal should fall for the next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially been taken into account where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a part in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should actually defend the law , to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the block@@ age and not to admit . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human Rights Organization of the wave of website lock@@ outs . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible web pages and media .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog is dom@@ ic@@ iled , on the other hand is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported the student protests and recorded a video as the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the one that blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , then it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words influence , though only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for posting articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ ade of providers , which was possible through the implementation of Internet cens@@ orship and private browsing , called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could access Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ ors leave behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed in court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will fight it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?

day after day newspapers all over Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year old school shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 achieved the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on 16 August published the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry out : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the designation &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence is referred to as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state security policy for years .
these security policies also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years the U@@ PP has been increasingly taking a look at sh@@ kan@@ es and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also cause serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways typical of a war . this involves penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the residents of fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : learning en@@ ag@@ ged Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and during the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime opposite lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege , which caused the inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gling food .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional foodstuffs in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and reli@@ eved his relief that it is now more and more &quot; of public@@ ity . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ it@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday 04 . September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was possible they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portuguese demand justice for victims of 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ ging in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state in solidarity with the victims for three days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts only .

the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the objective of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and anti @-@ fire measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val writes in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the people : they used the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who missed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .

in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the dawn , the boy was to break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban who were known for their hatred came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon before the open windows so we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life behind Iran without papers and was ready to travel to Europe .
during the dangerous sailing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised installations in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his bound@@ less ben@@ evol@@ ence helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans operated businesses , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant relates to the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Padua . Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail outlets and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which people can learn packaging and sale techniques . &quot; they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt permit shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users need to be able to use social networks within six months of the competent bill of law on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who negl@@ ect this step may be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the expul@@ sion of a pen@@ alties .
the law , which was promoted by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently in the legislative process as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may a further MP filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ults of the President or a high officer would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the defend@@ ants .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ position of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest members who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of amongst others weapons of possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was speaking to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been inter@@ rog@@ ated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , to guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies .
the document , published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the template look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which gives journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media .
in addition , it is stated in the provisions that registration with the full real name will be required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat bla@@ sted in the state government as the &quot; organizer of dissemination of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services , which will organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court features a ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as &apos; lock in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication had declared that the site had been blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to combat a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services with respect to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
