<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and pursued his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I had met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "in the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in stark contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either share his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note D.): as much as "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnic groups," white in reference to the whites and whiplash, meaning the big Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyanist, whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America that promises and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "shouted the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who isn't like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocal" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps country now, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (music gang) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its use of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare ray of hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and play the trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">The children of Cateura are playing more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, is made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where parents worked in trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Country fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publishing takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorns, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to baptise one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority, recalls. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering the stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are, in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the Premier had expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail stamp, which circulated information between individual countries, actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable at the FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details found or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load his captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among others, actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, fantasies of fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You cannot run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole now tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "and we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">That's why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Sea Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and the position of every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "ew Charitable trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without licence and hardly had to expect consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reported a 33% increase in fishing revenues since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets there on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "With certainty, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country of Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela appear to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the imposition of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela refused the opposition to a referendum for impeachment, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went to the void by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTeaDeVenezuela (about: the order of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country is continually worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and profit rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum on ministerial change was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, urged the demonstrators to continue the process against the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was to continue the blocking of the referendum for the removal of the office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is far from Venezuela: dawn National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike, and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral safely again, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano has now spoken against his father in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were examined.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a maid.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerist. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my dad started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you made yourself friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Be careful not to kidnap you one day and then I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Labor Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he prohibited me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a gait.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda materials, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were parked and kept me under a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a song tortured on people.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there.</seg>

<seg id="350">Elaboration of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, a daily newspaper in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists involved in accidents across the country is a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for widespread transmission of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who don't have foreign employees, still make translations firsth. then the Japanese employee, whose English language skills are assessed as the best, is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distorted and enigmatic phrases that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also survived the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositionist groups who oppose NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was tied and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission on Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilElectro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly is transferring its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web page is blocked by the DNS, the server responds faulty or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS barrier: @ elapoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked canal, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV returned to broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from university she went back to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become of something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began working as a criadita for the family. as a critically, one denotes the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with critizi - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criaazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which cries critically to the critizan guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "declares Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she should complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criaazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience only a few years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secrecy in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of heavy blows. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military house TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n was living with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira took a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criaazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there was "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows than children are registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The critizers are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik in which her father worked, had to bankrupt the bankruptcy and lost her father's work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stopped at five o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, she purified the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfects the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve but also didn't have unlimited food. "I could get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings, the owner of the household, Alvarenga, forced to stand next to him, and to read the editorial in opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to use citizens with permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and personal ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on the users. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior research technologist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), Global Voices said:</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense control is maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which sweeps through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxopolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish eco-system" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present." ""</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an accident in Fukushima fired the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's north-east, experiencing both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to be evacuated because the tsunami had left entire coast towns out of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima Prefecture has still experienced a nuclear accident, and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authorities as well as survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses (in the city of the city of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The largest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still tries to relocate six years after the disaster, evacuated from home accommodation (in the case of the use of a casetsu juutaku) into final substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there still lived 360,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees hauled to housing shelters were resettled to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">The number here is 34 percent for Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fukushima have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have greatly affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the" "" "nuclear barrier zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coastal population, it feels more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuated ones. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how her receiving has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is to those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture was also witnessing the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">At the end of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees, still living in Behelefarrihausen, are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely to these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a walk passes her affection to the Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa writes about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied Social Sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a traumatic brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>

<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer in GoiÃ¢nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page, "Desnealizador," a media channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz in the network in which one sees Mateus attacked by the police officer and rushed to him shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also reflected in social networks.</seg>

<seg id="617">The member of the Flavio Serafini, the social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from demonstrators on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustratively design their song pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window-window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">You have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of damage.</seg>

<seg id="625">The villages in Cuba that have been forgotten by the industralization</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of Ãlvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba included doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Municipality Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alam, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable harvest of sugar on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some exchanging the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran of soldiers who wake up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation again, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers closely to have heard that in MaÃ±alam I would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound according to the 2016 published report "Agricultural Prospectives" by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first shot of the month, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a question of officially written documents that would be distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed, the addressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve of any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was someone who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do so using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will make it possible for young participants to explore topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">"" "this video of the school" "" "Na Aksa Gyilak" "" "Yoo in the territory of the first nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called" "" "Highway of tears" "", "a street section in Westkanada where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."

<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey the importance of obtaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation added, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a stanhe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the stanhe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are placed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru) of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to making these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Togabashi district of Togabashi there are a large number of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually so that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend is turning it into showy mobile phones and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matomas published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in sale: new ones decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part was made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone supports and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing way to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddies (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more skurrile plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video will give you an insight into the neighborhood of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trade" in Mexico, the misses and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every dead body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with the drug trade"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives" "" ") tells these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or regard it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders if they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they mock those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Hauptstadtkonkt" as a family with threats had been plundered. "in this she describes how armed criminals put money on their business for month, until they had not only destroyed the business but also torn off their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violent Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who was shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and the government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the Narcodata journalism project whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade, which has tortured the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or to expose falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank car crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for many years and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives described a fireball, which wrapped dozens of houses, including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the football world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows numbers of charted bodies that are strung along the ground while individuals look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was listed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported drastically about atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said one inhabitant of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be displayed on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga had been a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was wrongly shown as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly falsely reflect the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning warning published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee are punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claimed that President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image of the DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This 2014 article about students who have been killed by Boko Haram, published by the now deleted news site AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly stated that the picture does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and retelling more than 9,300 times), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that allegedly was written by a "father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this one here in Vietnamese and declared it a false message.</seg>
<seg id="922">The organisation of the missionaries and father Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves from the embassy in which the image was taken from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web crawler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misunderstanding and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equated to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is the concern that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from context or completely abusive.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of wrong attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of untranslatable (e. unsettable) strives to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world, which are difficult or at all not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremea).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have strived around you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the HunsrÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The convenience or laziness that you feel after getting angrily in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page and show more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr-User Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird, the confisable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS lies not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has performed events since 2015, the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often" "" "is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to, to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first translate their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation are leading to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, storyteller Rassidatou conveys the opportunity to explain the habits of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyugara tells the navel from the hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fidelity, John Nyentreara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me all the time!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march commenced at the grassland of Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Ciudadano de la Deuda) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken away from his cell in Adra on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at present the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastian's cultural prototypes was more than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything in order to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural legacy of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">So far, Bassel could not yet complete this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with it, dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology for me. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have been detained in prison according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: President condemns corruption on previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger against corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodoino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants for the instigation of 54 million metics (some 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not know the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, abbreviated CIP) condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "it represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards for the efforts of our legal system," "" "CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have a disciplinary approach against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company seems to be silent and does not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case to be "disgusted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could consider paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitterone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has insulted the state so massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morality and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeus prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel and will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and incidental speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person is changing, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" "" "Indian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the use of the word "Kalar" as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call out hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about its use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, 'calar htaing' is written on Burmese, which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'calary hair' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty manner whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question-word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression much, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hung believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you're writing on factual.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by examining the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply start using a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts by telling his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author divided his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more prior to the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "stool" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook censorship has provided a lot of scaffolding among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were removed anyway:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and look at an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have risen.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to heighten violence in Myanmar's communities, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the balancing act of hate on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">In May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as this does not mean age. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children Rights, the minors as," "" "defined every man under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical center authorities confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media motions aimed to abolish child marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without a doubt they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critique of the childrens" "", "they should think about their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this seemingly uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for the childrens were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is wearing a ministerial commission in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which disguised the core of things, but do you know what? the childrens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's mind was, it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:, Hervoracious news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Act has been resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for that - 0 on the other hand!!!!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-proof age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years, regardless of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposal for amending marriage was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the guise of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take out judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate, if Maharaj wanted to proceed against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking, in a way that can only provoke panic and disgrace, if we, instead of talking about the problem that the state, which protects our daughters from being abused against them, would be abused by large, hard-boiled men that are opposed to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they fail.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia site was presented on January 18, 2012, in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular encyclopedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniquated Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia as recently published in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censor difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is irrevocable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the messages (via the barring of Wikipedia), we set out to place snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia in Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to grind the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wild wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just resting at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan al Qaeda lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to snout pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was already facing tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Buweik appeared. he immediately resigns, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. until 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband, and fear of the consequences, they should despise the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto, from the Indian State of Odisha, was convicted by a floodlight and rejected by her family and the village community after calling a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of calling their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have much less assignment to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign promoted by the Association of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage to the banning of HIV- and AIDS infected individuals, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion rounds traded women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To not pronounce the name of their husbands aloud, is a custom that they all duly maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not keep this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only chiching before him, and another decided to release the entire stunned frustration of him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put on the women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red spot if he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to bear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline cure, a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, morals related to the saris and much more, rough Rohini put their own couple of curdta in a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have done only small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it, but only when they are alone and not other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haggling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothing - are at the end of a heavily navigable river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here soon realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, presumably for abusive purposes, worried the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, the police officer of ZambÃ©zia declared to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are destination of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambique police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and residents of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, and this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique into consideration (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blogger poor Snassppa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MUST BE a Land in which people would have shame to walk on the street, as if the teachers would be ashamed to do their bread, a country in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or "black magic" are chased that aim to gain rapid riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for makabren humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic twitter user, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sangler, and the police spokesperson ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, both are bald:</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat) after having participated in the draft Charter of 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and told a speaker, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China continues to permit calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to release or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit Liu abroad a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the crew of the salmon to China, because the exports had largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union and the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to abolish all the limitations of Mr Lius's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message requested the Chinese authorities to free not only Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the invitation of the US embassy relocated a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in the Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Peking of news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns whether the vortex for Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the USA</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu Attorney previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and liberating the rights of these rights.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where needed. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will finally receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of mainland issues in Taiwan requested China to release Liu on 27 June and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called for China to allow the impotent intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compare Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the related questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire record of the conference, so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore should be so uneven if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have been winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said," "" "Don't be a country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who makes such a polemical statement as leader of an adolescent generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "committed a mistake" "" "or was it a wrong speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification then usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice" is basically to be idle - like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>

<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez narrates, people come in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry out: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also have been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurchee) poses with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the way," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp of Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his companions Michelet lived before in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakening, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez narrates that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is police officer and has found out that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that is why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, while others also open their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a sole educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers always consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she flirts with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair fleets that she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi gave a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the message is said to prevent the app" "" "preventing access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While news about digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet, "Images from mainland China," the censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police inspecting the residents randomly if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it may be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices designed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest-awakening technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (now available) also published a Jingwang product description which highlights that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimise the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumor's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offence, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, occasionally also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as feleymen (for example: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured into water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam on a burning hot young day.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking the lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in public during Ramadan in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior Jordan has cancelled the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert hall.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which question the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflected in an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib restored traditional gender norms by emailing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "Ehrenmorde" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Ehrenmorde reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law on combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "" "arrest indefinitely in prison" "", "and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee from the family that nothing will happen to the woman." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, later to note that his comments were torn from context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib says: if Abu Nuwhat, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">A short time ago, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service arrested several former government decrees and members of the Teachers' Association, stating that they have been critical of the problems linked to deep-rooted corruption in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the aid of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, streatunitions and artificial kind of driven democracies. at least, he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will further rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many regions of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the solid trolleys, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition dedicated to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid carriages are to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom external appearance and personal care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdressing arts instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "love messages of guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to offer affection to people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was precisely the question of the two young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la catliaciÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, who had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian collaborated and had to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He agreed to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the scope of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had done earlier in order to accept orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambusches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed a MGL garnet was lying, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly, tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, and was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC argued the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state came to an end to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">In our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the lap through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to retrieve a couple of shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you still want to honour the family, du Schandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got all along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two flukes in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which health-wing were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They said absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets above; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I hadn't changed my gender that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked about my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">In my mother it became too much and she lay a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark window panes and a license plate with 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you would be safe just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, which is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I carry still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed home?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been possible for these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, bore tube-jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never curved me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Spotte not about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when people make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrov stepped up the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but above all on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which job are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't tolerate a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I stumbled away places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to fool you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestaners have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all about it - I just know that I am I myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran that is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video violated on YouTube kept the moments when he lit up himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly made it clear to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>

<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family paternal who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a major part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran and some of the richest and most valuable crops for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically rejected the Ahrazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams that divert water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by drought, and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and to be hired, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional ial"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex continues throughout the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin colour, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists agree to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind which refer both to sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a terrible and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanarianism: claims to defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalization after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life is neither skipped nor ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads of domestic violence took place at the District Attorney's Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's advertisements came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the displays 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's ministries Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "for each woman, who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "for any woman who is refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible acts and a legal system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. she should regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most noticeable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and didn't leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of ill-treatment had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # Porellas (# fÃ¼rst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NioaMenos (# nonEineWeniger) are part of a campaign promoted by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law proposes to explain Femicid to an independent criminal offense and to punish the harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also win MEPs for the law, which feared that the road to decriminalize abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply wish to reimburse and receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2537">Anyone who is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to make such a long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been modified, among other things, a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">"" "" "" "the opinions on the changes are dealt with." ""</seg>
<seg id="2541">"" "" "" "the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victims." ""</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he is serving a year of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the Court but were later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, public liberties, freedom of the press, and to torture, intimidate and incarcerate independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn, its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Editor-in-Chief of Azamn, noted that an article entitled "High-level parties" was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was charged by the ISS in front of the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS arrested the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as Chief Editor after Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information gave the statement that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way, including online, is prohibited from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">The first trial in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in Maskat on 26 September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of "public order, misuse of the Internet," and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3,000 Korean rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, one year of professional ban against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a security deposit of 5000 ombian gial (13 000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Korean government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again asked the decision of the Court of Appeal to restore the publication of the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharma companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic first showed serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the use of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just launched a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That needs to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being makers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">"" "" "" "where does the financing and support come from?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines can only be made available for payment (the so-called Paywall), also restricts the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions to environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work has been limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or chewed leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton always breeds salad, but it needs longer since its work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, nobody can breed a new sort of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red RÃ¶mersalat of the variety Outbreaks in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds so as if the movement originated from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed produced by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others, as opposed to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, thereby making it usable for plant breeders either not at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to those that thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are far less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">Monsanto Speaker, Carly Scaduto, recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property restricts other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection therefore inhibits innovation, it promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, and certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "as a whole, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a species also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow naturally herbicides, who breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exact opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are small) patents, most smaller seed companies can survive, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "Morton is also considered to be more innovative breeders because of the prevention of plant patents:" "" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent." ""</seg>

<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leading the "Open Source" breeding program, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation is, however, not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official starting signal should fall for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true in spite of this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which should actually defend the law, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exploited to overcome the blockage and not to admit. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of website lockouts. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censor apparatus of the Egyptian government, became the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom also Ziadas's blog is domiciled, on the other hand is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported the student protests and recorded a video as the police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The one that blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, then it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words influence, though only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for posting articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockade of providers, which was possible through the implementation of Internet censorship and private browsing, called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web sites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could access Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censors leave behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed in court against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will fight it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants quarrel.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers all over Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year old school shot" "", "" "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 achieved the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" published on 16 August published the Editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry out: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the designation "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues that violence is referred to as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A Peace March in NiterÃ³i in the State of Rio de Janeiro in honor of the murdered Cultural Organizer Rafael Location.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia, is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is on position 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia stresses, has been repeating the state security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policies also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years the UPP has been increasingly taking a look at shkanes and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the designation "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio will also cause serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways typical of a war. this involves penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the residents of favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and during the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime opposite loyale troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege, which caused the inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smuggling food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional foodstuffs in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The director of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and relieved his relief that it is now more and more "of publicity."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the Humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the plantation of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday 04. September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuel is used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "", "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was possible they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were raging in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state in solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>

<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the people: they used the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn, the boy was to break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban who were known for their hatred came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open windows so we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life behind Iran without papers and was ready to travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous sailing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are disastrous." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000" "" "special reception centres" "". "they are improvised installations in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still withdraw for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his boundless benevolence helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans operated businesses, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant relates to the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua. Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail outlets and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, in which people can learn packaging and sale techniques. "they can sell their harvest surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along the way.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: bill drafts from Egypt permit shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in detention.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo taken by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users need to be able to use social networks within six months of the competent bill of law on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step may be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the expulsion of a penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty Members of Parliament, is currently in the legislative process as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may a further MP filed a legislative proposal in which harsher penalties for the insults of the President or a high officer would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, such action would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators, who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the imposition of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest members who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed on May 20, because the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges of amongst others weapons of possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was speaking to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi seating blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, to guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all illegally received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document, published on April 21 on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the template look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the nomination of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which gives journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, it is stated in the provisions that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "" "" "analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat blasted in the state government as the "organizer of dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services, which will organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court features a ban Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias' lock in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to erase two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication had declared that the site had been blocked because it became "a source of information that cooperates with groups to combat a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services with respect to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until 19 May. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
