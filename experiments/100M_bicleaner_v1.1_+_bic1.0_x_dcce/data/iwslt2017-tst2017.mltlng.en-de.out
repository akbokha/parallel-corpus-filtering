this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed out dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at tears , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters had done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of being imprisoned .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they claimed for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of spl@@ itting and spl@@ itting , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone references secret ,
just like his email , financial and bank information , his loan agreement , and even Rei@@ sen@@ ing with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of whist@@ leb@@ lower to journalists .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first amend@@ ment of the constitution because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as government technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they can accept that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today , there are communication software that has not yet existed when cra@@ ving had written its book , and it is considerably more secure than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers originally developed by Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I am working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as shown here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the W@@ hole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology designers like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bear the mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to report gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and reports of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who suggests f@@ lin@@ t water pollution . or a Wall street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data spot of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers tackle companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
it sounds like the agent &apos;s plot or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be crying from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is to be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans in this Dis@@ closure , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth into tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties in the USA .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of intim@@ acy in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked all that all up to a lawyer made proposals for how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very glo@@ omy as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this type of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the transparency that now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da got up and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I cut down there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking at the toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood actually were friends who were waiting only to be discovered ?
to house people on my air@@ mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is moving out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure that our cheese pro@@ sci@@ ut@@ to is completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is yet quite con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you concentrate on things you can do well . we have been able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we entr@@ ust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your cell phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your sm@@ s , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who is Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please on Twitter declare that he is candidate for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative assessments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
little surprising we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation pi@@ cks up com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ing@@ ra@@ ined preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re talking too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- is the request rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been met before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed parties to party or homes devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I participated in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million aver@@ aged nights had ever been a problem .
for people rightly trust each other .
when trust works , miracles can occur .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save lives even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they leave one to stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not do justice to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place one visits , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show one of a pub craw@@ l that has never been heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible for us instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government ,
were now offered residents . students looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were exp@@ elled . incub@@ ator programs have been started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was a kind of hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it ast@@ o@@ unding ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ st myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I was 17 years old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passive .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , turned into question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion deep@@ ening with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock rapidly turned into rebellion .
why should you do something like this ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ha@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only did my country be attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into suspici@@ on .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I went silent -- as we went silent -- as deep as I went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or people that were thought to be Muslims in the open and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can indeed hear people saying : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it will perhaps keep a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to view people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a head of the police in Washington , DC recently told me , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the group of extre@@ mes can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to think that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or reno@@ unc@@ ed by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add into their world of imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you take a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does ordinary Americans work ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one study shows that if people submit messages in which negative opinions were reported about Muslims , they voted against military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at when the mo@@ ods against Muslims rise up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental clinic , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had for@@ et@@ old courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go safe ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with a drau@@ ght , work in a clas@@ sy think tank , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a multi @-@ billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ par@@ c@@ els penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the public . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting planes , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build up winding structures independently .
they learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail starter ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starter motors , it can float , and has great advantages when it comes to start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that get together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ els , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
even though it is mechan@@ ically simple , a lot happens in the interior , so that it can fly st@@ ably , and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when I &apos;m all watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly in flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , though limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration will investigate synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units aff@@ ords a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway , the especially secure press would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , smart creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far away galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit up brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly mu@@ sty -- R@@ ai Weiss was decided by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Tur@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately by col@@ lu@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent issues .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two flas@@ hing black holes .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a til@@ ting in the texture of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and breath@@ ed into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance in courses about the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and du@@ st@@ le , stretch and du@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical essay on gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more of an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now it is just Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is stopping them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott is already busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same pen with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard that : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear will recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which revol@@ ve around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ aves an entirely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in All we can not see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light .
with gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o watched them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
in the end , Lig@@ o offers us a completely different view of the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , upset me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping words , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I plan@@ ed to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood completely that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I am thinking things , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , four TV programs , 21 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : &quot; how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work to understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you wear a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about this is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on her forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the sums I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t you understand me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t asp@@ ire to size .
the feeling of not being able to do anything other than striving to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there , the more things are happening , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just that bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ hau@@ led , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my D@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hey , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same ti@@ ti@@ ff work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked week@@ end@@ ings , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ mons .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you &apos;re working , you love what you do , be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another , and that gives one the sums when you know the sums , when you already know the sums , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all , and secondly , it didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and smo@@ g my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ our , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , al@@ ert@@ als and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy shift comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working sums , the titanium bu@@ zz , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sums are not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums are dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a general rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from all guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing lies not in the way I work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man does he prefer to be home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we gr@@ ate around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dancing parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the sums , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grant yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just stand for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan at training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is my sum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz of life .
the Sum@@ m@@ ary of Love .
the sum of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is snow@@ ing me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning .
the more I play , the more fortunate are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the hum@@ ming , the sums , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life is wide in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I &apos;m thinking things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to deal with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical interventions .
surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s suffer@@ ers suffering from severe sha@@ king and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull trauma .
they have to imagine that with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain wil@@ ts and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to make cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to make cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the biological classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark them far@@ ther in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ elected them at the Extra@@ ordinary Cham@@ bers of the same Individu@@ al .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ transplan@@ t these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ transplan@@ t the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ activated the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and re @-@ cul@@ tured exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ activated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex the hand mot@@ oric range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand any more .
just as it would happen to humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance of prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we re @-@ loc@@ alized the cells : the same monkey , two months after implantation .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable property .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs carried out in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my bud@@ dy friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you to an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are m@@ asked , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but only a few recognize their twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , which , however , are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and in@@ comes with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.@@ 4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 Bil@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an infinite loop , fears the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , fear@@ ing , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and more decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same bal@@ lot in questions of the state of the state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , while the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and escap@@ es it .
wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not up to the degeneration of its DNA .
it is because you can now be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my coat with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med the politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ assemble politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ shing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin tops higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts more deeply , just as it is , very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something that resembles the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , and humans indul@@ ge their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of the company : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all the income comes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , to which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no raising twin tops .
in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of each country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today , we have it , in particular against the backdrop of a re @-@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time the secretary in whom she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something that I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do it , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not working , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek one , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said it . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have clearly stated what you consider from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the world is playing , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this happened .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive ret@@ arding line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have still chosen den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt range at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to overthrow our government just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were going through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the credi@@ tors of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us stood : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , it seems to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will be equally det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having stayed at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an hed@@ ger and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy might not select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review .
if your show is nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the middle output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and through an evaluation he sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for free , one acc@@ esses , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ ders at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of staging a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the ratings they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed firms .
they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you gather millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
one optim@@ izes it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this area ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict failure of influ@@ enza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data abo@@ unds into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful choices based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , so that it can make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
so , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all those parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV @-@ ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
